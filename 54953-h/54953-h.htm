<div class="transnote">

<h2 class="nopagebreak" title="">Transcriber’s Note</h2>
<p class="covernote">The cover image was created by the transcriber, and is placed in the public domain.</p>

<p>Most pages started with a sidenote showing the year. These were printed
in bold and partially underlined. They have been moved to the start of
paragraphs, and kept only when they change. For some long paragraphs,
which were printed over several pages, a range of dates is shown.</p>

<p class="hh">Other sidenotes give the actual date of an
event. These have been moved next to the description of the date, and
are shown in parentheses, e.g. <i>{30 May}</i>, or show a change of year. Others, which merely repeat
a date, have been removed.</p>

<p class="not_hh">Other sidenotes, in italics, either give the actual date of an
event, or show a change of year.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been renumbered and moved to the end of chapters.</p>

<p>All references to footnote numbers (i.e. page and note number) have been changed to the footnote numbers used here.</p>

<p>Some formatting and punctuation in citations, sidenotes and the index
have been standardized.</p>

<p>Variant spelling, inconsistent hyphenation and inconsistent spelling of people’s names are retained,
however a few palpable printing errors have been corrected. Opening
brackets within brackets have been left unclosed. Other changes are
listed at <a href="#end_tn" title="">the end</a> of the book.</p>

<p>Throughout this book the abbreviation <i>ib.</i> is used to refer to the same work as the previous reference,
and <i>l.c.</i> or <i>loc. cit.</i> is used when the reference is to the same place in the referenced work
(or <i>ll.cc.</i> where the reference is to more than one page).
Each has been linked to the citation to which it refers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1216</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the 19th of October, 1216, King John lay dead in Newark
castle. Nearly half of his realm, including the capital, was
in the hands of a foreign invader who was supported by a
numerous and powerful section of the English baronage as
well as by the citizens of London; and the sole surviving
male representatives of the royal house of England were two
boys, the elder of whom was but nine years old. The King
had been cut off suddenly, at a moment when not one of his
English counsellors was at his side; and the small body of
troops which he had brought with him from the west consisted
almost entirely of foreign mercenaries. It might well have
been expected that these men would, as soon as the “landless
king” was dead, transfer their services to his rival. But John
had possessed that mysterious gift which seems to have
been common to the whole Angevin house, the gift of inspiring
a personal attachment out of all proportion to the merits of
its object. These men, seemingly without any leader to direct
their action, took upon themselves and faithfully and
successfully fulfilled the duty of carrying into effect John’s
last wishes, so far as lay in their power, by conveying his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
corpse across England from Newark to Worcester, and calling
on the loyal barons to meet them there for the double
purpose of burying the dead King and concerting offensive
and defensive measures to secure the rights of his heir.<a name="Anchor_1" id="Anchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a></p>

<p>John’s last act had been to commend his eldest son to
the care of the Earl of Pembroke, William the Marshal.
“Sirs”&mdash;thus he is said to have addressed the few friends who
stood around his death-bed&mdash;“I must die. For God’s sake,
pray the Marshal to forgive me the wrongs that I have done
him. He has always served me loyally, and never requited
me an ill turn for any evil that I have done to him or
said to him. Sirs, for God’s sake Who made the world, pray
him that he will forgive me; and because I trust in his loyalty
more than in that of any other man, I beg you that he may
have my son in his charge, and always keep him and guard
him; for the child will never be able to hold his land through
any one, unless it be through the Marshal.”<a name="Anchor_2" id="Anchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> When the
Marshal, who was at Gloucester, “heard say that the King his
lord was dead, he was grieved thereat.” He set out at once
to meet the funeral train at Worcester; Gualo the Legate,
who no doubt also was somewhere in the west of England,
did the like; and a goodly company of clerks and knights
were present with them at the burial. As soon as it was over,
“the great men”&mdash;that is, probably, the Legate and the
Marshal&mdash;hurried back to Gloucester, and sent out a summons
to all those barons who held with the King to join them there
without delay. The appeal met with a quick response; a
council was held, and all present unanimously agreed that
they should send for little Henry “and do with him what God
should teach them to be reasonable and right.” The child
had been placed for safety in the castle of Devizes; Sir
Thomas de Sandford was despatched to fetch him thence,
and the Marshal went as far as Malmesbury to meet him.<a name="Anchor_3" id="Anchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a></p>

<p>The heir of England was gifted with more than the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
attractiveness inherent in youth and innocence; he had a
beautiful face, with golden hair, and he was already noted for
a gravity and dignity of speech beyond his years.<a name="Anchor_4" id="Anchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a> A
faithful retainer, Ralf of Saint-Samson,<a name="Anchor_5" id="Anchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a> was “carrying him
in his arms”&mdash;that is, probably, holding him on the horse’s
neck before him&mdash;when, in the plain outside Malmesbury,
William the Marshal met the little company coming from
Devizes. The Marshal saluted the future King; “and the
well-trained child said to him, ‘Welcome, Sir! Truly, I
commit myself to God and to you, that for God’s sake you
may take care of me; and may the true God Who takes care
of all good things grant that you may so manage our business
that your wardship of me may be prosperous.’ ‘Fair Sir,’
answered the Marshal, ‘I tell you loyally, as I trust my soul
to God, I will be in good fealty to you, and never forget you,
so long as I have power to do anything.’” The boy burst into
tears, and the bystanders and the Marshal did the like
“for pity.”<a name="Anchor_6" id="Anchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a></p>

<p>Most of the barons of the King’s party were now at
Gloucester, and anxious that the coronation should take place
without delay. One, however, who ranked next to the
Marshal in importance&mdash;Ranulf, Earl of Chester&mdash;had not yet
arrived, and it was not without some hesitation that the others
ventured to take so important a step in his absence. The
urgency of the case however overcame their scruples and
their fears of Ranulf’s displeasure;<a name="Anchor_7" id="Anchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a> and on the eve of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Simon
and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Jude<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>27 Oct.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>&mdash;ten days after John’s death&mdash;a council over
which the Legate presided made the final arrangements for
crowning the King the next morning.<a name="Anchor_8" id="Anchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a> At the last moment
a question arose: who was to knight the boy? <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>“Who should do
it,” one of the assembly answered, “save he who, if we were a
thousand here, would still be the highest and worthiest and
bravest of all&mdash;he who has already knighted one young king<a name="Anchor_9" id="Anchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a>&mdash;William
the Marshal? God has given him such grace as
none of us can attain. Let him gird the sword on this child;
so shall he have worthily knighted two kings.” It was done;
and next morning<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>28 Oct.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> the “pretty little knight, clad in his little
royal robes,”<a name="Anchor_10" id="Anchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a> was led in solemn procession to the abbey
church. Standing before the high altar, he recited, under the
dictation of the Bishop of Bath,<a name="Anchor_11" id="Anchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a> the old traditional coronation
oath: that he would, all the days of his life, maintain the
honour, peace, and reverence due to God, His Church, and
His ordained ministers; that he would render right and justice
to the people committed to him; that he would abolish bad
laws and evil customs, if any such were in the realm, and
would observe good laws and customs and cause them to be
observed by all men. He then did homage to the Holy
Roman Church and the Pope for the realms of England and
Ireland, and swore that so long as he held them, he would
faithfully pay the thousand marks promised by his father to
the Roman see. This homage must have been done to Gualo
as the Pope’s representative. It was followed by the crowning
and anointing which made Henry king. This most
solemn rite was carried out with as much of the customary
ceremonial as circumstances permitted.<a name="Anchor_12" id="Anchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a> The Archbishop of
Canterbury, who according to immemorial precedent should
have performed it, was beyond the sea. Gualo alone had, as
Legate, a right to take the Primate’s place on such an occasion;
but it seems that he tactfully declined to do so, and commissioned
a member of the English episcopate to act in his
stead, while he himself undertook the more ordinary duty of
singing the Mass. The very crown was a makeshift, “a sort
of chaplet”<a name="Anchor_13" id="Anchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a>&mdash;probably an ornament for a woman’s hair, belonging
to the Queen-mother. Under the sanction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
legatine authority Bishop Peter of Winchester, assisted by the
Bishops of Worcester and Exeter, anointed the child and
placed this improvised crown on his head.<a name="Anchor_14" id="Anchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a></p>

<p>When the service was over Philip d’Aubigné caught up
the tired child in his arms, carried him back to his apartments,
and caused him to be relieved of his heavy robes before proceeding
to the hall where the coronation banquet was spread.<a name="Anchor_15" id="Anchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a>
The company at the high table must have been a small one;
besides the Legate, the Queen-mother,<a name="Anchor_16" id="Anchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a> and six bishops,<a name="Anchor_17" id="Anchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a>
there seem to have been present at the coronation only six
persons of sufficiently high rank to be mentioned by name
in the chronicles of the time; the Earls of Pembroke and
Ferrers, Philip d’Aubigné, John Marshal,<a name="Anchor_18" id="Anchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a> William Brewer,
and Savaric de Mauléon.<a name="Anchor_19" id="Anchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a> There was however a considerable
gathering of abbots and priors, and “a very great crowd” of
lesser folk.<a name="Anchor_20" id="Anchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">[20]</a> In the midst of the banquet a messenger made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
his way into the hall and delivered to the Earl Marshal aloud,
in the hearing of all, an urgent appeal for succour from the
constable of Goodrich castle, besieged on the preceding
afternoon by some partisans of Louis. Goodrich was only
twelve miles distant, and the incident was naturally felt to be
a bad omen.<a name="Anchor_21" id="Anchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a> Guided by a common instinct, all the little
company around the King turned, as John had turned many
a time, to William the Marshal as their one hope, and before
they separated for the night they went to him with the same
request which had already been made to him by John
and by little Henry himself: “You have made our
young lord a knight; he owes his crown to you; we all of
us together pray you to take him into your keeping.” “I
cannot,” answered William, “I am old; the task is too heavy
for me. Leave the matter till the Earl of Chester comes.”
With this answer he dismissed them for the night.<a name="Anchor_22" id="Anchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a></p>

<p>Next morning<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>29 Oct.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> Ranulf of Chester arrived, just as they were
all about to do homage, as was usual on the morrow of a
coronation, to the new King. Ranulf did his homage like the
rest, and expressed his approval of all that had been done in
his absence. A meeting was then held “in the King’s hall,”
for the purpose of choosing “a valiant man to guard King
and kingdom.” The Bishop of Winchester&mdash;no doubt
according to arrangement made on the preceding night after
the Marshal had withdrawn&mdash;called on Alan Basset to speak
first. “By my faith!” spoke Alan, “fair sir, though I look
up hill and down dale, I see no one fitted for this, save the
Marshal or the Earl of Chester.” Again the Marshal protested
that the matter was too hard for him: “I am too
feeble and broken, I have passed fourscore years. Take it
upon you, Sir Earl of Chester, for God’s sake! for it is your
due; and I will be your aid so long as I have strength in life,
and will be under your command loyally to the uttermost of
my power; never shall you command me aught, by word or
by writing, that I will not do as well as I may by God’s helping
grace.” “Out upon it!” cried Chester, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>“Marshal, this
cannot be. You, who in every way are one of the best
knights in the world&mdash;valiant, experienced, wise, and as much
loved as you are feared&mdash;you must take it; and I will serve
you and do your behests, without contradiction, in every way
that I can.” Hereupon Gualo called the Earl, the Marshal,
the Bishop of Winchester, and one or two others into an
inner room, where the matter was discussed among them
privately. No conclusion, however, was reached, till at last
the Legate “besought the Marshal for God’s sake, and
required of him that he should undertake the charge for the
remission and pardon of his sins, that he might be fully
absolved of them before God at the Day of Judgement.”
“In God’s Name!” said the Marshal, “if I am saved from
my sins, this charge befits me well; I will take it, however
burdensome it may be.” “Then,” adds his biographer, “the
Legate gave it to him, as was right; and the good Marshal
received the King and the guardianship both together.”<a name="Anchor_23" id="Anchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 23.">[23]</a></p>

<p>The Marshal’s forethought went beyond that of the others.
Having accepted the charge of the regency, he at once made
a suggestion which shewed that he intended to do the work
of that office thoroughly. “My lords, you see the King is
young and tender; I should not like to lead him about the
country with me. So please you, I would seek out, by your
counsel, a wise man who should keep him somewhere at ease.
This is necessary; I will not drag him about with me. I
shall not be able to stay in one place, but must travel about
and look to the safety of the Marches. Wherefore, I would
have some master provided and chosen for him in your
presence, to whom I can intrust him with security.” “Let
the choice be yours, Sir,” said the Legate, “for we have no
fear but you will choose rightly.” “Then,” answered William,
“since you leave the whole matter to me, I will give him in
charge to a very good master, the Bishop of Winchester, who
has already had the charge of him and has brought him up
carefully and well.” To this all agreed,<a name="Anchor_24" id="Anchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">[24]</a> and it seems to have
been in this way that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>“by common consent, the care of King
and kingdom was committed to the Legate, the Bishop of
Winchester, and William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke.”<a name="Anchor_25" id="Anchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a></p>

<p>There was no fear of these arrangements being unacceptable
to the rest of the King’s party. Throughout all England
there was but one opinion of William the Marshal; and when
“the folk outside” heard that he had undertaken the governorship
of the King and the realm, “they rejoiced greatly.” But
within the castle, when darkness fell, the old Earl once more
called around him “his sure council”&mdash;three faithful friends;
his nephew John Marshal, his squire John of Earley, and
Ralph Musard<a name="Anchor_26" id="Anchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 26.">[26]</a>&mdash;with whom he had already had an anxious
consultation on the preceding night, after the first informal
offer of the regency.<a name="Anchor_27" id="Anchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a> Now, setting his back against a wall,
he began: “Give me your counsel! for, by my faith, I have
embarked on a wide sea where, cast about as one may, neither
bottom nor shore can be found, and it is a marvel if a man
come safely into port. But may it please God to bear me
up! They have given me this charge, which is like to
miscarry,<a name="Anchor_28" id="Anchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">[28]</a> as you may see and know; and the child has no
possessions, worse luck! and I am an aged man.” He paused,
choked by tears; “and they, who loved him with all their
hearts, wept too for pity.” Recovering himself, he asked
them: “Have you nothing to say to me?” “Yes,” answered
John of Earley. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>“You have undertaken a business from
which there is no drawing back. But so long as you hold to
it, I tell you that the worst that may come can only bring you
honour. Suppose that all your adherents should join Louis,
and surrender all the castles to him, so that you could find no
shelter anywhere in England;&mdash;that you had to quit the
country, and that Louis pursued you till you fled to Ireland;&mdash;still
that would be great honour! And if a losing game could
thus turn to your praise, how much greater will be your joy
when you get the better of the adversary, as, please God, you
may! Then all men will say that never man of any race won
such honour upon earth. Is it not worth the winning?”
“By God’s sword!” swore the aged hero, “your counsel is
true and good, and goes so straight to my heart that if all the
world should forsake the King, save myself, know you what I
would do? I would carry him on my shoulders from one
land to another, and never fail him, though I had to beg my
bread.” His friends applauded his resolution, and he, having
now cast aside all misgivings, closed the conference with
characteristic simplicity. “Now let us go to bed; and may
God Who rules over all things give us His counsel and aid, as
He surely does aid those who wish to do right and cleave
unto loyalty.”<a name="Anchor_29" id="Anchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">[29]</a></p>

<p>He took up his new duties without further hesitation.
Under his direction letters were immediately despatched to all
the sheriffs and wardens of castles throughout England, bidding
them render obedience to the new King;<a name="Anchor_30" id="Anchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a> and Gualo called
upon the prelates and the loyal barons to meet the King and
his guardians in a council at Bristol on November 11<span class="sn_extra"><i>11 Nov.</i></span>. When
the council met, it comprised the whole strength of the loyal
party. Only eleven bishops indeed were present; but the
statement made in a royal letter that “all the prelates”<a name="Anchor_31" id="Anchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a> of
England were there was practically true nevertheless; for the
two metropolitans were both out of the country, the Bishops
of London, Lincoln, and Salisbury were ill, and the sees of
Durham, Norwich, and Hereford were vacant. The laymen
who attended were the Earls of Pembroke, Chester, Derby (or
Ferrers), and Aumale, the Justiciar Hubert de Burgh, Savaric
de Mauléon, the two William Brewers (father and son), Robert
de Courtenay, Falkes de Bréauté, Reginald de Valtort, Walter
de Lacy, Hugh and Robert de Mortimer, John of Monmouth,
Walter de Beauchamp, Walter and Roger de Clifford, William
Cantelupe, Matthew FitzHerbert, John Marshal, Alan Basset,
Philip d’Aubigné, and John L’Estrange, besides others whose
names are not recorded; and there were also some “other
prelates,”&mdash;that is, abbots and priors&mdash;and knights.<a name="Anchor_32" id="Anchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a> Gualo,
who as representing the overlord of King and kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
necessarily acted as president of the council, began by causing
every man present to swear fealty to the King; he then laid
an interdict upon the whole of Wales “because it held with
the barons,” and repeated his excommunication of the rebels
and their allies, with Louis of France at their head.<a name="Anchor_33" id="Anchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a></p>

<p>Next day<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>12 Nov.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> there was issued a provisional Charter, purporting
to be granted by the boy-King “under the guidance of God,
and for the salvation of our soul and of the souls of all our
ancestors and successors, to the honour of God, and the
exaltation of Holy Church, and the amendment of our realm,
by the counsel of our venerable fathers” Gualo and the
other prelates and magnates enumerated. Of course it began
with the declaration which had already been, and was to be
again, so often made, and so often proved but an empty form:
“The English Church shall be free, and have her rights and
liberties entire and undisturbed;” but the recital in the first
article of the Great Charter of John’s grant, made to the
Church before his quarrel with the barons, of one special
liberty&mdash;that of free election&mdash;was omitted.<a name="Anchor_34" id="Anchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a> The clauses
of John’s Charter regulating the reliefs due from tenants-in-chief,<a name="Anchor_35" id="Anchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a>
the wardship of heirs under age,<a name="Anchor_36" id="Anchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a> the marriage of heirs

of which the most significant was an addition to the
clause relating to the custody of estates: that the obligations
laid down as binding on the guardian of a lay fief were to be
binding likewise on the custodian of a vacant ecclesiastical
dignity, and that a wardship of this kind was not to be

Nineteen articles were entirely omitted. There was no
renewal of the articles forbidding the exaction of interest,
during the minority of a debtor’s heir, on money borrowed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the Jews or others; nor of the royal promises to institute an
inquiry into the abuses of the Forest law and of the Crown’s
rights over escheated baronies, to remove from all offices in
England certain of John’s foreign adherents, to make
restitution to persons illegally disseised under John, to remit
fines made illegally with him, to reinstate Welshmen
illegally disseised under Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> and Richard, and to
appoint no justiciars, constables, sheriffs, or bailiffs, save those
who knew the law of the realm and were minded to observe
it well.<a name="Anchor_67" id="Anchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 67.">[67]</a> The articles declaring that the ferms of the shires,
wapentakes, and hundreds should be reduced to their old
figures, without increment (except on royal manors);
sanctioning the distribution of the chattels of an intestate
freeman by his next-of-kin under the direction of the Church,
after his debts were paid; and giving leave to all men to go
in and out of England freely, except in time of war,<a name="Anchor_68" id="Anchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 68.">[68]</a> were
also omitted. Above all, there was no renewal of two
provisions of the highest importance: that no scutage or aid
should be imposed except by the common consent of the
realm, unless it were for the King’s ransom, the knighting of
his eldest son, or the marriage of his eldest daughter, and of
“reasonable” amount, and that for the assessment of an aid
or scutage on occasions other than those named, the common
council should be summoned in a certain manner and for a
fixed day, and the matter should proceed according to the
counsel of those who answered the summons.<a name="Anchor_69" id="Anchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 69.">[69]</a> As a natural
consequence of this omission, the article providing that no
mesne lord should henceforth receive permission to take an
aid from his freemen except of reasonable amount and for the
before-named purposes<a name="Anchor_70" id="Anchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 70.">[70]</a> was omitted likewise. The weighty
sixtieth article of the Great Charter, however&mdash;“All these
aforesaid customs and liberties which we have granted in our
realm, so far as in us lies, to be kept towards our own men,
all the people of our realm, both clerks and laymen shall
observe, so far as in them lies, towards their men,”&mdash;was
retained.<a name="Anchor_71" id="Anchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 71.">[71]</a> The provisions for the return of hostages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
and charters, and for a settlement of terms with King
Alexander of Scotland,<a name="Anchor_72" id="Anchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 72.">[72]</a> were of course omitted, being no
longer applicable under the altered political circumstances.
The grounds on which the other omissions and modifications
were made are thus set forth in the clause with which the
Charter concludes, and which replaces the sixty-first clause of
the Great Charter (the clause containing the arrangement
about the twenty-five “over-kings”): “Forasmuch as in the
former charter there were certain chapters which seemed
weighty and doubtful, to wit, concerning the assessment of
scutages and aids, the debts of Jews and others, the liberty
to go in and out of our realm, the forests and foresters, warrens
and warreners, and the customs of the shires, and the river-enclosures
and their keepers: it has pleased the prelates and
magnates that these should be deferred till we shall have
taken counsel more fully; and then we will do to the full,
concerning these and other matters which may require amendment,
whatever things may appertain to the common good
of all and the peace and stability of our self and our realm.”<a name="Anchor_73" id="Anchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 73.">[73]</a></p>

<p>The seals with which, in place of the non-existent royal
seal, this Charter was confirmed in the King’s name were those
of Gualo the Cardinal Legate and William the Marshal, Earl
of Pembroke, “governor of ourself and our realm.” The form
of the document must have been determined by Gualo and
William conjointly; and it reflects the utmost credit upon the
wisdom, tact, and moderation of both. Their explanation,
given in the clause just quoted, as to the omissions in the new
Charter was reasonable and true. The matters omitted were
such as a provisional government, especially under the existing
circumstances, could not safely deal with. They were all,
more or less, matters of controversy; they were also matters
affecting the relations of the Crown not with the nation as a
whole, but with certain members or sections of the nation;
matters, in a word, as to which it would have been neither
politic nor just to tie the hands of a King who was not yet
capable of acting for himself&mdash;above all at a moment when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
any surrender of the powers and claims of the Crown might
have deprived him and his counsellors of the already
sufficiently small means which they possessed of carrying on
the war against the invader. Most “grave and doubtful” of
all was the question which had furnished the immediate
pretext, though it was certainly not the sole incentive, for the
rising of the barons against John: the question of scutage. If
the limitations imposed by the twelfth and fourteenth articles
of the Great Charter upon the King’s rights of scutage were
not actually new, they had been obsolete so long as to be
practically an innovation on the established custom of the
realm. This fact was the coign of vantage on which John
had taken his stand when appealing to the Pope against the
barons; and it was on this ground that Innocent had
condemned the Charter. The accession of a child-King was
not the moment for gratuitously surrendering on his part a
claim whose illegality was, to say the least, not proven, and
which the Pope, as overlord of the kingdom, had upheld; and
the postponement of this question enabled Gualo at once to
give the papal sanction to the new Charter. The publication
of the Charter, with that sanction, left no valid excuse for the
continuance of a refusal to recognize the native sovereign.
Henry was now as definitely pledged as Louis to the redress
of all grievances which were really national, and the security
for the fulfilment of the pledge was at least as strong on
Henry’s side as on the side of the stranger.</p>

<p>But the stranger was in the land, with a force of armed
followers of his own, sufficient, if not indeed for its conquest,
at least to keep the footing which he had gained there; and
the men who had called him to their aid were bound to his
cause by engagements from which they could not easily
extricate themselves, even if they wished to do so. When
they heard of Henry’s coronation they were furious, and
many of them took a solemn oath that they would never hold
land of any of John’s heirs. Gualo retorted by interdicting
their lands; and his arguments, pleadings, and threatenings
had a considerable effect not only on the clergy to whom they
were primarily addressed,<a name="Anchor_74" id="Anchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 74.">[74]</a> but also on the lay folk of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
King’s party, whose loyalty was greatly encouraged by hearing
their enemies excommunicated every Sunday and holiday.
This, together with a general feeling that “the sins of the
father should not be visited on the son,” inclined John’s old
adherents to serve the new King even more zealously than
they had served the late one; and they set to work vigorously
at the fortification of their castles in his behalf.<a name="Anchor_75" id="Anchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 75.">[75]</a></p>

<p>At the moment of John’s death Louis was still, with the
greater part of his forces, encamped, as he had been for three
months, before Dover castle, and was awaiting the results of
a truce which had been made between him and its warden&mdash;Hubert
de Burgh&mdash;in the early part of October, to enable
Hubert to communicate with John and obtain from him either
succour, or leave to surrender. When fully certified of John’s
death, Louis invited Hubert to a parley and addressed him
thus: “Your lord, King John, is dead; it is useless for you to
hold this castle longer against me, seeing you have no succour;
surrender the castle and come into my fealty, and I will
enrich you with great honours and you shall be great among
my counsellors.” “If my lord be dead,” Hubert is reported
to have answered, “he has sons and daughters who ought to
succeed him; as to surrendering the castle, I would fain
speak with my comrades of the garrison.” These all agreed
that he should refuse, “lest by shamefully surrendering the
place he should incur the mark of treason.”<a name="Anchor_76" id="Anchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 76.">[76]</a> On this Louis
consented to another truce with Hubert till after Easter,<a name="Anchor_77" id="Anchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 77.">[77]</a> and
withdrew to London.<a name="Anchor_78" id="Anchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 78.">[78]</a> The Dover garrison immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
sallied forth and foraged around till they had stocked the
castle with all necessaries, after burning all the buildings
which Louis had set up round about it;<a name="Anchor_79" id="Anchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 79.">[79]</a> while Hubert was
by this somewhat unexpected release enabled to join the
council at Bristol.</p>

<p>The French party now held, besides London, the chief
strongholds of Surrey and Hampshire&mdash;Reigate, Guildford,
Odiham, Farnham, Winchester, Southampton, Porchester;
Marlborough, just within the Wiltshire border, seems to have
been their extreme western outpost. In the Midlands and the
North they held Mountsorel and most of the castles of
Yorkshire. Between these northern fortresses and London,
however, lay a tract of hostile country. The Thames Valley
was blocked by Windsor and Oxford; two of John’s foreign
followers, Engelard d’Athée (or de Cigogné) and Andrew de
Chanceaux, were in command of Windsor; while the castles
of Oxford, Buckingham, Hertford, Bedford, Cambridge, and
Northampton, and the whole of the six shires in which they
stood, were under the charge of the most devoted and energetic,
as well as the most ruthless, of John’s soldiers from over sea,
Falkes de Bréauté. Beyond these lay Nottingham, Newark,
Sleaford, and Lincoln, whose castles were all in the possession of
the royalists.<a name="Anchor_80" id="Anchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 80.">[80]</a> To the east, though the Earls of Essex and
Norfolk were among the partisans of Louis, the castles of
Pleshy, Colchester, Norwich, and Orford were garrisoned
by the troops of the King.<a name="Anchor_81" id="Anchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81.">[81]</a> In the far north Newcastle-on-Tyne
was held for Henry by Hugh de Baliol,<a name="Anchor_82" id="Anchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 82.">[82]</a> and the
fortresses of the see of Durham by the constables of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Palatine bishop. The western shires were entirely in the
hands of the Royalists. On the Dorset coast Peter de
Maulay, to whom John on the eve of his last campaign had
entrusted his second boy, Richard, was in command of Corfe,
a fortress which on account of its remote position and great
strength had been chosen for the depository of the greater
part of the royal treasure.<a name="Anchor_83" id="Anchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83.">[83]</a> The French had apparently no
hold upon the coast anywhere except at Southampton and
Porchester, and at Rye, where the castle was held for Louis
by Geoffrey de Say.<a name="Anchor_84" id="Anchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84.">[84]</a> Some of the Cinque Ports had indeed
submitted to Louis in 1215, but they had almost immediately
thrown off his yoke, resumed their allegiance to John, and
joined hands with a motley band of adventurers and country
folk who under the leadership of William de Casinghem
occupied the Weald of Kent and were a perpetual danger to the
French troops engaged in the siege of Dover.</p>

<p>That siege Louis seems to have now finally decided to
abandon, probably with the intention of devoting himself
instead to the consolidation of his conquests by the acquisition
of eastern England. On 11th November&mdash;the meeting-day
of the Council at Bristol&mdash;he appeared before Hertford and
laid siege to the castle. For twenty-five days he plied his
machines against it in vain, its commandant, Walter de
Godardville, a knight of Falkes’s household, making a brave
defence and a great slaughter of the assailants, till the siege
was ended on 6th December<a name="Anchor_85" id="Anchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85.">[85]</a> by a general truce made between
the Royalist leaders and Louis on the condition that
Hertford and Berkhamsted should be evacuated and surrendered
to the French prince.<a name="Anchor_86" id="Anchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 86.">[86]</a> The constable of Berkhamsted,
however&mdash;a German knight named Waleran, who
had long been in John’s service&mdash;was unwilling to accept the
truce, and held out against siege and assault till an order
in the King’s name compelled him to surrender on 20th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
December.<a name="Anchor_87" id="Anchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 87.">[87]</a> When the truce expired, another was made, the
condition being the evacuation and surrender of the royal
castles of Orford and Norwich;<a name="Anchor_88" id="Anchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 88.">[88]</a> and this second truce seems to
have been followed by a third, purchased probably by the
surrender of Cambridge and either Colchester or Pleshy.
At some date between the middle and the end of January,
1217,<span class="sn_extra"><i>1217</i></span> Louis called his adherents to a council at Cambridge,
while the King’s guardians brought up their young sovereign
from Gloucestershire to Oxford,<a name="Anchor_89" id="Anchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89.">[89]</a> and opened negotiations for
a peace, or, failing that, a further prolongation of the truce.
Of peace Louis’s English supporters would not hear; and as
the arrangements for another truce made but slow progress,
Louis laid siege to the castle of Hedingham. Finally,
however, a truce was made, its conditions being apparently
the surrender of Hedingham and Colchester (or, if Colchester
had been surrendered earlier, Pleshy), and perhaps some minor
strongholds, and the continuance of “all things”&mdash;castles and
other matters&mdash;as they were at that moment until a month
after Easter.<a name="Anchor_90" id="Anchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 90.">[90]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1217</div>

<p>Thus by the beginning of February, 1217, Louis’s mastery
of eastern England was completed, seemingly without a
struggle. At first glance, the action of Henry’s representatives
seems unaccountable; there is, however, reason to think that
it was really part of a scheme for bringing the desultory war
to a crisis. Their aim seems to have been first to induce
Louis to scatter his forces, and then to lure him back to the
coast, hoping that there they might either cut off his retreat, or
compel him to return to his own country.<a name="Anchor_91" id="Anchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91.">[91]</a> For the accomplishment
of this design it would be necessary to concentrate
their own forces; and this could only be done by withdrawing
the garrisons from such of the royal castles as were least
worth retaining at the moment. These were the castles of
East Anglia and Essex. Unlike the fortresses of the west,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
which it was of paramount importance to maintain in a state
of efficiency as a protection against encroachments of the
King’s enemies from the Welsh border, these eastern castles
were practically isolated outposts in a district of which the
greater part was under the enemy’s control. Surrounded as
they were by the territories of powerful barons who supported
Louis, they were not available as bases for concerted action;
and the stores, arms, horses, and men in them could be made far
more useful elsewhere.<a name="Anchor_92" id="Anchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92.">[92]</a> To the enemy, on the other hand, the
bait would be a tempting one; and the possible consequences
of taking it might well have escaped the penetration of a
more wary general than was Louis of France at this stage of
his career. The possession of these castles placed the whole
of eastern England under his uninterrupted sway, and removed
all serious obstacles, except one, to his communications with
his allies in the north. That one obstacle was the castle of
Lincoln, which under the command of a woman had hitherto
resisted every assailant. Louis appears to have made a
circuit of his new possessions&mdash;no doubt placing a garrison in
each of them&mdash;and then proceeded to Lincoln, hoping that
his personal presence and the isolation in which she was now
placed might tempt or frighten Dame Nicolaa into a betrayal
of her trust. In this hope he was disappointed. The city
received him, as it had already received his adherents; but
the castle “held out,” for the Dame “kept it very loyally.”
Louis could only return to London and thence send the
castellan of Arras to take up his quarters in Lincoln city, that
he might “hold the country with the help of the Northerners.”<a name="Anchor_93" id="Anchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93.">[93]</a></p>

<p>Louis was now anxious to get back to France. According
to one account, his father was again urgently calling him
home;<a name="Anchor_94" id="Anchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 94.">[94]</a> according to another, he was alarmed by letters from
his agents at Rome, telling him that unless he left England
the Pope intended to confirm on Maundy Thursday the
excommunication which had been pronounced on him by
Gualo.<a name="Anchor_95" id="Anchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 95.">[95]</a> When he announced to his English friends in London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
his intention of leaving the country they were highly displeased,
and he had to take a solemn oath that he would return before
the expiration of the truce.<a name="Anchor_96" id="Anchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 96.">[96]</a> None of the successive truces
made during this winter seem to have been very scrupulously
kept by either party. On the morrow of the surrender of
Berkhamsted<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>1216 21 Dec.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> Louis had marched upon <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Alban’s and
demanded homage of the abbot, and on its refusal had only
been restrained from burning both abbey and town by the
intervention of Saer de Quincy, whereby the abbot was persuaded
to give him eighty marks for a respite till Candlemas.<a name="Anchor_97" id="Anchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 97.">[97]</a>
A month later<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>1217 22 Jan.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>, at the very time when the King’s Council were
endeavouring to arrange a conference of commissioners from
both sides for the redress of infractions of the first and second
truces and for securing the observance of the truce then
existing,<a name="Anchor_98" id="Anchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98.">[98]</a> Falkes de Bréauté sacked the same unlucky town
and wrung from the abbot another heavy fine.<a name="Anchor_99" id="Anchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99.">[99]</a> Louis’s visit
to Lincoln was not an overt act of hostility such as these,
but it was distinctly a violation of the spirit of the conditions
on which the last truce had been made; and the Royalists
may perhaps have considered themselves thereby released
from their own obligation to abide by those conditions.
However this may be, Louis, seemingly on the point of setting
out from London for the coast, received information that the
castle of Rye had been “taken by subtlety” by the English.<a name="Anchor_100" id="Anchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100.">[100]</a></p>

<p>As early as 17th December, 1216, “the brave men of
Ireland who are with their ships on the coasts of Normandy”
had been bidden, and encouraged by the promise of liberal
reward, to come in force to Winchelsea, ready and prepared
to go forth in the King’s service on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hilary’s day, or as soon
after as possible.<a name="Anchor_101" id="Anchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 101.">[101]</a> They seem to have obeyed the summons,
and to have been joined by an English fleet, gathered no
doubt from the loyal Cinque Ports, and commanded by the
governor of the Channel Islands, Philip d’Aubigné.<a name="Anchor_102" id="Anchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 102.">[102]</a><span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>Jan.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
detachment of Royalists, protected by, if not actually landed
from, these ships, had “by the wise counsel of the Marshal”
now surprised and occupied Rye.<a name="Anchor_103" id="Anchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 103.">[103]</a> Louis at once set out for
the coast; he went, however, not direct to Rye, but to
Winchelsea&mdash;still, it seems, intending to sail for France. At
his approach the burghers of Winchelsea broke up all the
mills in their town, and then took to their boats and went to
join Philip d’Aubigné and his fleet off Rye. Louis had no
sooner entered Winchelsea than he found himself caught in
a trap whence there was no way of escape&mdash;shut in between
the new garrison of Rye, the ships, and the Weald, where
“Willikin” de Casinghem was still in command of a
dauntless and reckless band of loyalists who broke down
every bridge and blocked every passage in the rear of the
French, and cut off the head of every straggler who came
within their reach.<a name="Anchor_104" id="Anchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 104.">[104]</a></p>

<p>Louis and his men were soon on the verge of starvation;
there was plenty of corn in the town, but no means
of grinding it save the slow process of rubbing it between
their hands; they could get neither flesh nor fish; their
“best food” consisted of some “large nuts” which they
found in the town. For a while they struggled on, making
occasional truces with the ships’ men, probably for the purpose
of being able to fish without molestation and thus
procure a little food; but the sailors paid little or no regard
to these truces, and even came ashore to shoot at the enemies.<a name="Anchor_105" id="Anchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 105.">[105]</a>
At last Louis sent some messengers who contrived to slip
through the Weald to London for succour. Some of his
knights there set out to rescue their lord; but they dared not
attempt to pass through the Weald, so they went by the high
road through Canterbury to Romney, and thence&mdash;as it was
impossible for them to proceed from Romney to Winchelsea
without passing Rye&mdash;despatched a message to the governor
of the county of Boulogne asking him to send them all the
ships he could get. He sent, it is said, over two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
vessels&mdash;probably only small boats&mdash;all of which save one
came into port at Dover, and were speedily occupied by the
French knights who hastened thither from Romney; but a
succession of storms kept them waiting a fortnight before
they could sail. Meanwhile Louis and his men had possessed
themselves of several large ships which were lying in the
harbour of Winchelsea; and one of the vessels sent from
Boulogne had, “by the hardihood of the mariners,” contrived
to evade the English fleet and reach the same place, “where it
was very welcome.” In all likelihood the captain of the ship
which achieved this exploit was a man who for many years
past had been known on both sides of the Channel as the
most daring of seamen and the most ruthless of pirates,
Eustace “the Monk”; for it was Eustace who now proposed
to build, on one of the large ships, a “castle” wherewith to
attack the English. This “castle” was “so big that everyone
stared at it with wonder, for it overpassed the sides of the ship
in every direction.” A stone-caster was next set up on another
ship, to hurl stones at the English fleet; Louis had already
set up on the shore for the same purpose two similar
machines, whose missiles went almost across the channel
which separates Winchelsea from Rye; and these did the
English ships considerable damage. But one evening the
English brought up some of their vessels close to the town,
stole away the galley which bore the “castle,” and hewed it
in pieces before the very eyes of the French. Louis laid
the blame of this mishap on the Viscount of Melun, who
apparently was responsible for the watch that night; Melun
bluntly declared the men were so hungry that not four knights
could be found to undertake the watch; Louis retorted that
he would take it himself. Then Eustace de Neville interposed,
saying he would find forty knights to watch with him
as long as Louis pleased. That night he did it, with forty of
his friends, “very honourably”; and next morning the
relieving squadron from Dover came in sight. The English
ships threatened to intercept it; but the first English vessel
which came to close quarters by some accident struck
one of its own consorts and sank it with all its crew,
and amid the confusion resulting from this catastrophe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
the French ships made their way safely into the harbour of
Winchelsea.<a name="Anchor_106" id="Anchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 106.">[106]</a></p>

<p>With these ships Louis, whose force is said to have
now consisted of more than three thousand men, proceeded
to Rye, which the English garrison, seeing they could not
defend it, evacuated.<a name="Anchor_107" id="Anchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 107.">[107]</a> By this time the Marshal<a name="Anchor_108" id="Anchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 108.">[108]</a> and the
other members of the Council were on their way up from the
west of England to a general muster of the Royalist forces at
Dorking. Thence, on 28th February, a letter was despatched
in the King’s name to the townsfolk of Rye, bidding them
take courage, give no hostages to Louis, and make no terms
with him, for they would speedily receive “greater succour
than they could believe possible.” The Bishop of Winchester,
the Marshal, the Earls of Chester, Ferrers, and Aumale,
nearly all the barons of the western March (Walter de Lacy,
Hugh and Roger de Mortimer, Walter and Roger de Clifford,
William de Beauchamp, John of Monmouth, “and others”),
and several other well-known leaders (William de Harcourt,
Engelard de Cigogné, William de Cantelupe, Falkes de
Bréauté, Robert de Vipont, Richard FitzRoy), with a
multitude of knights, men-at-arms, and crossbowmen, and
some loyal Welshmen, were setting out for Rye at once, and
the King himself was about to follow with the Legate and
a crowd of clergy and “crusaders.”<a name="Anchor_109" id="Anchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 109.">[109]</a> But before this letter
was written Louis had made his escape. After appointing
his nephew Enguerrand de Coucy as his representative in
England, with orders to go to London “and not stir thence
upon any account,” and leaving a French garrison in Rye,<a name="Anchor_110" id="Anchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 110.">[110]</a>
he had slipped away to Dover, and thence sailed on 27th or
28th February to France.<a name="Anchor_111" id="Anchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 111.">[111]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>The Legate meanwhile had turned the war into a crusade.
He had set the example, which the prelates followed, of
assuming in token of the sacredness of the young King’s
cause the white cross which marked the English warriors in
Holy Land; all loyal subjects were exhorted to do the like;
and those who had already taken the cross with the intention
of joining the host now on its way to Egypt were encouraged
to exchange their intended pilgrimage for the struggle with
the excommunicate enemies at home.<a name="Anchor_112" id="Anchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 112.">[112]</a> Nobles and common
folk alike responded to this appeal, “preferring to have a
king from their own land rather than a foreign one.”<a name="Anchor_113" id="Anchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 113.">[113]</a> All
through the winter the tide had been turning surely though
slowly. As early as the end of November, 1216, William of
Aubigny, the lord of Belvoir, who in the preceding year had
defended Rochester castle for the rebel party with a stubborn
bravery worthy of a better cause, and on its capture had been
sent by John to prison at Corfe, bought his release by a fine
of six thousand marks and homage to the new King; he
was at once intrusted with the castle of Sleaford, “and he
kept it right valiantly.”<a name="Anchor_114" id="Anchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 114.">[114]</a> Two recruits of yet greater
importance joined the Royalist forces a few days after Louis
left England: the younger William Marshal&mdash;eldest son of
the regent&mdash;and the king’s uncle, William Longsword, Earl
of Salisbury. These two, “who loved each other like
brothers,”<a name="Anchor_115" id="Anchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 115.">[115]</a> seem to have been already contemplating a return
to their natural allegiance in the second week of December,
1216;<a name="Anchor_116" id="Anchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 116.">[116]</a> but their scruples or their fears kept them in the
hostile camp for three months longer. Then, in the first days
of March, the elder Marshal “met them by the way” somewhere
between Shoreham and Knepp.<a name="Anchor_117" id="Anchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 117.">[117]</a> The meeting was
evidently pre-arranged.<a name="Anchor_118" id="Anchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 118.">[118]</a> All three spent the night together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
at Knepp; and when the two younger men parted from the
elder one next morning, it was to lead their followers to
Winchester and besiege it for the King.<a name="Anchor_119" id="Anchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 119.">[119]</a> The old Marshal
followed them with another body of troops, and laid siege to
Farnham in the first week of March.<a name="Anchor_120" id="Anchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 120.">[120]</a> By 12th March it was
taken;<a name="Anchor_121" id="Anchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 121.">[121]</a> and so, too, about the same time, was the city of
Winchester and “the lesser castle” there&mdash;that is, the Bishop’s
castle, known as Wolvesey.<a name="Anchor_122" id="Anchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 122.">[122]</a> The “tower,” or royal castle,<a name="Anchor_123" id="Anchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 123.">[123]</a>
however, held out against the united forces of the two friends
and the regent, who on leaving Farnham came to their
assistance. At last it was decided that he should continue
the siege,<a name="Anchor_124" id="Anchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 124.">[124]</a> while his son and Longsword led their forces
to Southampton or Odiham,<a name="Anchor_125" id="Anchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 125.">[125]</a> and another party under Philip
d’Aubigné was sent to besiege Porchester.<a name="Anchor_126" id="Anchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 126.">[126]</a> On the last day
of March the younger Marshal laid siege to Marlborough; and
“after great difficulty” he took it.<a name="Anchor_127" id="Anchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 127.">[127]</a> Southampton and Odiham
had now been regained;<a name="Anchor_128" id="Anchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 128.">[128]</a> Chichester was won before 16th
April, and Porchester before 27th April.<a name="Anchor_129" id="Anchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 129.">[129]</a> Meanwhile Falkes
de Bréauté had made a raid on the Isle of Ely and recovered
possession of it for the King.<a name="Anchor_130" id="Anchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 130.">[130]</a> The royal forces were swelling
fast; “converts”&mdash;as the rebels who returned to allegiance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
are called in the official records&mdash;came crowding in;<a name="Anchor_131" id="Anchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 131.">[131]</a> and
after Easter the Marshal, while still blockading the “tower”
of Winchester, felt himself strong enough to despatch the
Earls of Chester, Aumale, and Ferrers, with Robert de
Vipont, Brian de Lisle, William de Cantelupe, and Falkes,
and a number of knights and men-at-arms drawn from the
garrisons of the evacuated royal castles, to form the siege of
the rebel Earl of Winchester’s great fortress of Mountsorel in
Leicestershire.<a name="Anchor_132" id="Anchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 132.">[132]</a></p>

<p>Tidings of these things reached Louis in France; “and
when he heard them,” says a contemporary, “he was not at all
glad.” About Easter time he had betaken himself to Calais,
but with only a very small following; if he had gone to
France with the hope of gathering forces there, he must have
been disappointed. He had, however, procured a new
machine called a trebuchet, “about which there was much
talk, for at that time few of them had been seen in France.”
With this machine, and a handful of knights&mdash;only one
hundred and forty&mdash;he at last set sail<a name="Anchor_133" id="Anchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 133.">[133]</a> for England once
more on Saturday, 22nd April.<a name="Anchor_134" id="Anchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 134.">[134]</a> As the French ships drew
near to Dover on the morning of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> George’s day<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>Sunday, 23 April<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>, their
occupants saw the huts which had been built to shelter the
besiegers of the castle still standing, empty but intact. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
that very moment, however, King John’s son Oliver and
Willikin of the Weald came down upon the huts and set them
on fire, after slaughtering some of the few men who had been left
to guard them. To attempt a landing at Dover in the face
of an enemy whose numbers and position it was impossible to
distinguish amid the smoke thus raised, and who could so
easily pour down a murderous fire of arrows and other missiles
from the cliffs, would have been to court destruction. Louis
therefore altered his course and made for Sandwich. There
he succeeded in landing,<a name="Anchor_135" id="Anchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 135.">[135]</a> though not without opposition from
some of the local ships.<a name="Anchor_136" id="Anchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 136.">[136]</a> Next day he rode to Dover and
took up his quarters in the priory. There he heard dismal
reports of the losses suffered by his adherents in other parts of
England; so he hurriedly arranged with the constable of the
castle for a further prolongation of the local truce,<a name="Anchor_137" id="Anchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 137.">[137]</a> and
returned to Sandwich. Having now been joined by the Count
of Nevers with a few followers, he dismissed the inferior
portion of his own forces to the ships, which he sent back to
France,<a name="Anchor_138" id="Anchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 138.">[138]</a> but, as the sequel showed, with instructions to return.<a name="Anchor_139" id="Anchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 139.">[139]</a>
Then, after firing the town of Sandwich in vengeance for the
hostility of its mariners,<a name="Anchor_140" id="Anchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 140.">[140]</a> he moved on to Canterbury; next
day (Tuesday, 25th April) he set out for Winchester. At
Malling he was met by Saer de Quincy, Simon de Langton,
and some others of his English partisans. On the morrow
(Wednesday, 26th) he “made a long day’s march, for he
went from Malling to Guildford”; his baggage could not get
beyond Reigate. On this day he was joined by Enguerrand
de Coucy and the greater part of the garrison which he had
left in London. Next day (Thursday, 27th) he reached
Farnham, but only to find it prepared for defence against him,
and to learn that Winchester castle was lost to him,<a name="Anchor_141" id="Anchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 141.">[141]</a> its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
castellans having surrendered it before they knew of his
return to England.<a name="Anchor_142" id="Anchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 142.">[142]</a></p>

<p>No sooner did the Marshal hear that Louis was back than
he gave orders for the immediate razing of all the castles
which had been retaken, except Farnham.<a name="Anchor_143" id="Anchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 143.">[143]</a> It was Farnham
that Louis now turned to attack. The outer bailey was
speedily captured by assault; but the keep, as a foreign
chronicler quaintly says, “heeded it not.”<a name="Anchor_144" id="Anchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 144.">[144]</a> Next day
(Friday, 28th April) Earl Saer of Winchester came to Louis
asking for help to relieve Mountsorel.<a name="Anchor_145" id="Anchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 145.">[145]</a> Its garrison of ten
knights and some men at arms under Henry de Braybroke
had held out manfully for nearly a month, but had now found
it needful to ask their lord, Saer, for succour.<a name="Anchor_146" id="Anchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 146.">[146]</a> After some
consultation Louis, “being unable to get rid of him otherwise,”<a name="Anchor_147" id="Anchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 147.">[147]</a>
sent him to London with orders that some of the
leaders there should supply him with troops and accompany
him to Mountsorel for the twofold purpose of relieving that
fortress and “subduing the whole province” to Louis himself.
Under the joint command of Saer, the count of Perche, Robert
Fitz Walter, and some other barons, a large body of knights
and men-at-arms, some English, some French, and “all
coveting their neighbour’s goods,” as an indignant chronicler
says, set out accordingly from London on Monday, 1st May.<a name="Anchor_148" id="Anchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 148.">[148]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>From <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Alban’s, where they halted for the night, the
French mercenaries went about plundering churches, desecrating
cemeteries, and putting “all sorts of people” to torture
and ransom; at the abbey they got nothing but food and
drink, Louis having apparently given it to be understood that
he was “satisfied” with the larger sum which he had recently
extorted from the abbot, and that they must exact nothing
more. A marvellous experience which befell some of the
sacrilegious spoilers at Redburn<a name="Anchor_149" id="Anchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 149.">[149]</a> probably sobered them somewhat,
for they passed through Dunstable “without doing much
harm.”<a name="Anchor_150" id="Anchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 150.">[150]</a> When, a few days later, they reached Mountsorel,
they found that, so far as that castle was concerned, their work
was done. The leaders of the besieging force had had
timely warning from their scouts, and had withdrawn to
Nottingham.<a name="Anchor_151" id="Anchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 151.">[151]</a></p>

<p>Louis meanwhile had on Saturday, 29th April, marched from
Farnham to Winchester, his rearguard chased by a party of
Royalists from Windsor, who, however, failed to overtake it.
The Marshal, after demolishing the castle as much as haste
permitted, had evacuated the city, and the few Royalists left
in it fled at the approach of the French. Louis stayed there
five days, to put in train the restoration of the castle. On
4th May&mdash;Ascension Day&mdash;he left the completion of this
work and the custody of the city to the Count of Nevers, and
set out once more for London.<a name="Anchor_152" id="Anchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 152.">[152]</a> There he heard that the
garrison of Dover had broken their truce, and chased and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
slain some of his men who had arrived at Dover after he left
it. He stayed in London two nights and then went on to
Dover, and on the Friday before Whit-Sunday, 12th May, set
up his trebuchet before the castle, while his men built
themselves huts all around in preparation for a renewal of the
siege. Next day (Whitsun Eve) forty of his ships reappeared,
seeking to enter the harbour; but a contrary wind drove them
back to Calais, all except five, which made their way in
together. On Monday, 15th, the other thirty-five came again
from Calais. At the same time there hove in sight some
eighty or more ships “great and small,” among them twenty
“great ships armed and prepared for battle,” coming from
Romney under Philip d’Aubigné and Nicolas Haringot.
The small French transports, not daring to risk a meeting
with these big vessels, fled towards Calais; twenty-seven of
them however had advanced so far that they could not
withdraw in time to avoid an encounter; eight of these were
captured, the sailors and men-at-arms whom they carried were
slain at once, and the knights imprisoned in the holds of the
ships, “where they were uncomfortable enough.” The
victorious English ships then anchored before the castle, thus
effectually cutting off its besiegers from all chance of
reinforcement by sea. Louis vented his rage by sending some
of his men by land to burn Hythe and Romney; the
“Wealdsmen” attacked them, but seemingly without success.<a name="Anchor_153" id="Anchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 153.">[153]</a></p>

<p>While Louis was in London, the host which had gone to
relieve Mountsorel moved eastward to Lincoln, at the urgent
request of Hugh of Arras, who went in person to beg that
they would all join him and his “Northern” friends at the
siege of Lincoln Castle. He was, he said, almost on the point
of taking it, and its capture would be a great advantage to
the cause of Louis. After some debate the leaders consented,
and the whole force marched to Lincoln and quartered itself
in and around the city.<a name="Anchor_154" id="Anchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 154.">[154]</a> Tidings of this movement reached
the Marshal on the Friday before Whit-Sunday<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>12 May<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>&mdash;the day on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
which Louis set up his trebuchet at Dover&mdash;when the council
and the loyal barons were gathered round the King at
Northampton for the approaching festival.<a name="Anchor_155" id="Anchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 155.">[155]</a> Hereupon, says
his biographer, “God, Who supports, maintains, and counsels
all loyal men, put into their hearts a marvellous counsel, of
which came much good and much honour to them. List,
then, the sum of the counsel with which God inspired the
man chosen and renowned and trusted above them all.
‘Hearken,’ spoke William the Marshal, ‘loyal knights and all
ye who are in fealty to the king! For God’s sake hearken
to me, for what I have to say deserves a hearing. This day
we bear the burden of arms to defend our fame, and for
ourselves and our dear ones, our wives and children, and to
keep our land in safety, and to win great honour, and for the
peace of Holy Church, which these men have wronged and
ill-used, and to gain remission and pardon of all our sins.
Take heed then that there be no backsliders amongst us.’”<a name="Anchor_156" id="Anchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 156.">[156]</a>
After this solemn exordium he put the situation clearly
before his audience. Part of the enemies were sieging
Lincoln Castle, but only a part; Louis was elsewhere, and
“those who accompanied him had got themselves foolishly
into a tangle.”<a name="Anchor_157" id="Anchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 157.">[157]</a> Here, then, was an opportunity not to be
lightly thrown away. “For God’s sake, let us stake everything
upon it! Remember that if we gain the victory, we
shall increase our honour, and preserve for ourselves and our
posterity the freedom which these men seek to take from us.
We <i>will</i> keep it. God wills us to defend it! Therefore every
man must bestir himself to the utmost of his power, for the
thing cannot be done else. There must be no gaps in our
armed ranks; our advance upon the foe must be no mere
threat; but we must fall upon them swiftly. God of His
mercy has granted us the hour for vengeance upon those who
are come hither to do us ill; let no man draw back!” The
whole assembly “took heart and hope, strength and hardihood”
from his words, and became eager to go forward at all
costs.<a name="Anchor_158" id="Anchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 158.">[158]</a> So, with the unanimous consent of Gualo and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
other members of the royal council, the Marshal called upon
all loyal castellans and knights to muster at Newark on
Whit-Monday, 15th May.<a name="Anchor_159" id="Anchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 159.">[159]</a> They came gladly, to the number
of four hundred knights, near two hundred and fifty cross-bowmen,
and so many sergeants and horsemen as might well
make up for the small number of knights.<a name="Anchor_160" id="Anchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 160.">[160]</a> The leaders of
the host were the two William Marshals, Bishop Peter of
Winchester (who was “learned in the art of war”), the Earls
of Chester, Ferrers, and Aumale, William d’Aubigny, John
Marshal, William de Cantelupe with his son of the same
name, Falkes de Bréauté, Thomas Basset, Robert de Vipont,
Brian de Lisle, Geoffrey de Lucy, Philip d’Aubigné, “and
others.”<a name="Anchor_161" id="Anchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 161.">[161]</a></p>

<p>Next day arose a new peril, which recalls one of the
incidents that preceded another battle at Lincoln, seventy-six
years before. “The Normans who were in the host”
went to the younger William Marshal and addressed him
thus: “Fair sir, you were born in Normandy; you ought to
know that it is the right of the Normans to strike the first
blow in every battle. Take heed that we lose not our right.”
Earl Ranulf of Chester, however&mdash;like his father in 1141&mdash;claimed
the same privilege for himself, and bluntly declared
that unless he were placed in the van, he would not go with
the host, and they should have no help from him. The Earl
Marshal and the other leaders were obliged to pacify him by
granting his demand, on the understanding that the right of the
Normans should not be thereby prejudiced for the future.<a name="Anchor_162" id="Anchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 162.">[162]</a>
Three days were spent at Newark<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>Tues., 16 May<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>, as a breathing-time for
men and horses and an opportunity for religious exercises to
prepare the men for their task. On the third morning<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>Fri., 19 May<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>, after
Mass, the Legate and clergy again excommunicated Louis
by name, with all his accomplices and abettors, especially
those who were sieging Lincoln castle, “together with the
city of Lincoln and all its contents.” The Legate then gave
plenary absolution to all who, having made a truthful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
confession, were about to take part in the expedition.<a name="Anchor_163" id="Anchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 163.">[163]</a> This
done, the whole host flew to horse and arms.<a name="Anchor_164" id="Anchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 164.">[164]</a></p>

<p>The Legate set out for Nottingham,<a name="Anchor_165" id="Anchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 165.">[165]</a> taking with him the
young King. For the fighting men, the direct route would
have been the Foss Way, which ran in an almost straight line
from Newark to Lincoln. But it ran to the southernmost gate
of the city, below the hill; and their aim was to reach the
western side of the castle on the hill-top without passing
through the city, which was in the hands of the enemy. They
therefore fetched a compass to the northward as far as
Torksey;<a name="Anchor_166" id="Anchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 166.">[166]</a> and there, or at Stow<a name="Anchor_167" id="Anchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 167.">[167]</a> hard by, they spent the
night. On Saturday morning (May 20th), after Mass, they
drew up in full array for their final march upon Lincoln.<a name="Anchor_168" id="Anchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 168.">[168]</a>
Once more the Marshal bade them fight, “for honour or
Paradise,” against the enemies of God and the Church.
“God has given them into our hands; up and at them! The
hour is come!” “And all who heard him bore themselves
joyfully, as if they were going to a tournament.”<a name="Anchor_169" id="Anchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 169.">[169]</a> Chester
led the van; the Marshal and his sons commanded the next
division; Earl William of Salisbury the third, and Bishop
Peter of Winchester the fourth, which consisted of cross-bowmen.<a name="Anchor_170" id="Anchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 170.">[170]</a>
Another body of cross-bowmen&mdash;perhaps commanded
by Falkes&mdash;seems to have formed an advanced guard
which marched a mile in front of the rest of the host.<a name="Anchor_171" id="Anchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 171.">[171]</a></p>

<p>The boundaries of medieval Lincoln were determined by
those of the Roman city on the site of which it was built.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>They formed, roughly speaking, a parallelogram whose length
from north to south was considerably greater than its width,
and whose northern half stood on the summit of a steep and
rocky hill whence the southern half sloped down almost to
the bank of the river Witham; the whole was divided
longitudinally by the Roman road known as Ermine Street.
The city “above hill” represented the original Roman camp;
to this the part “below hill” had been added in the later days
of the Roman occupation. The wall wherewith, in the
thirteenth century and for many centuries after, the whole
was encompassed, followed in the main the outlines of the
Roman enclosure thus enlarged. The castle, founded by
William the Conqueror and partly reconstructed in the
twelfth century, occupied the south-western angle of the first
Roman city: it was thus enclosed on the north, east, and
south within the later city, from which it was separated by a
wide and deep ditch. This ditch was continued along its
outer or western side; and on this side the walls of castle and
city formed one continuous line, the wall being carried across
the ditch at the north-western and south-western extremities
of the castle enclosure. Immediately north of the ditch at the
former of these two points of junction between the city wall and
the castle wall, stood the West Gate of the city; whether there
was also a gate at the southern junction point is not known.
The castle had two main entrances; one on the east, towards
the city; the other on the west side, towards the open country.
The keep was on the south side. Beyond the western wall
and ditch the plateau formed by the hill-top extended some
little distance; and it was here that King Stephen had
entrenched himself when he besieged the castle in 1141,
leaving the bishop and citizens to watch the other three sides.
The partisans of Louis seem not to have been sufficiently
sure of the citizens to venture on following Stephen’s
example; for they had evidently made no attempt to occupy
the site of his encampment, but had set up all their machines
and concentrated all their forces within the city, directing all
their attacks upon the castle from thence, and taking no steps
to prevent its garrison from communicating through the
western sally-port with their friends outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>The main road from Torksey and Stow to Lincoln now
enters the city south of the castle; but there is a branch road
connecting it at Burton with an old Roman way which runs
from Kirton-in-Lindsey and enters Lincoln by the West
Gate; and this appears to have been the way taken by the
Royalists. At some distance from the gate they halted,
and the Marshal sent forward his nephew John to open
communications with the garrison.<a name="Anchor_172" id="Anchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 172.">[172]</a> On his way John met
Dame Nicolaa’s lieutenant constable, Geoffrey de Serland,
whom she had despatched from the castle secretly to tell the
leaders of the relieving host how matters stood within, and
that a “little door,” or “postern at the back”&mdash;that is, the
small door of the western sally-port, by which no doubt
Geoffrey himself had gone out&mdash;was already open to receive
them.<a name="Anchor_173" id="Anchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 173.">[173]</a> With this welcome message John Marshal hastened
back; he was seen and chased by some Frenchmen, but
escaped unharmed.<a name="Anchor_174" id="Anchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 174.">[174]</a> Two of the English barons who were
in the city, Robert Fitz-Walter and Saer de Quincy the Earl
of Winchester, rode out to reconnoitre as soon as the
Royalists’ approach was known. On their return they said:
“These warriors come on in good order, but we are far more
in number than they; let us go out to meet them at the
ascent of the hill, and then we can catch them all like larks
in a cage.” The Count of Perche, however, who was in
command of the French troops, was too cautious to act upon
a report so vague and went out himself with another of the
French leaders, to count the enemies, as he said, “according
to the custom of France.” He was, however, deceived in his
reckoning; for each of the Royalist chieftains had two
banners, one of which led his contingent in the fighting host
while the other was with his baggage, so that the baggage,
forming a separate group in the rear, looked like another
army and was mistaken for such by the two Frenchmen, who
went back doubting what was best to do. They finally
decided to shut the city gates and thus, as they hoped, hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
the city till they should have won the castle<a name="Anchor_175" id="Anchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 175.">[175]</a>; thinking that
the English, with men and horses wearied from a long march,
would not attempt to penetrate within the walls. When this
movement came to the knowledge of the Marshal, he made it
an argument for instant attack. “See, they retire behind
their walls! The victory is ours already, when these men,
ever foremost in tourney, hide themselves at our approach.
Let us do the right, for God wills it!”<a name="Anchor_176" id="Anchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 176.">[176]</a></p>

<p>It was easy to introduce troops into the castle by the
western sally-port; but it would not be so easy to pass the
whole relieving force through the castle into the city. Bishop
Peter of Winchester, who according to the Marshal’s biographer
“was the master in counselling our people that day,”<a name="Anchor_177" id="Anchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 177.">[177]</a>
seems to have resolved on trying to ascertain for himself where
a direct entrance into the city could be effected. He led his
men up to the castle wall, bade them await him there, and
with a single attendant entered the fortress. He found it
greatly damaged by the long siege, and in such constant peril
from the French mangonels and stone-casters, still actively at
work, that its occupants begged him to withdraw from the
great court into the shelter of the keep. Thence, after
complimenting and encouraging the “good dame,”<a name="Anchor_178" id="Anchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 178.">[178]</a> he
stole out, evidently by the small south door,<a name="Anchor_179" id="Anchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 179.">[179]</a> on a yet more
hazardous reconnoitring expedition into the city, “wishing to
see how it stood.”<a name="Anchor_180" id="Anchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 180.">[180]</a> Looking about him, he caught sight of a
gate “which joined the walls of the city with those of the
castle,” and which was “blocked with stone and cement.”
This was apparently the West Gate of the city.<a name="Anchor_181" id="Anchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 181.">[181]</a> The reason
for which it had been blocked, whether this was done by the
French or (as is more probable) under orders from Nicolaa<a name="Anchor_182" id="Anchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 182.">[182]</a> at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
an earlier period of the war, is not difficult to guess. Lincoln
had more gates than could easily be guarded all at once;<a name="Anchor_183" id="Anchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 183.">[183]</a>
if one of them was rendered impassable, there was one less to
watch and defend. The sequel implies that the “stone and
cement” were not so put together as to form a wall of solid
masonry; probably the door on the inner side of the gateway
had been closed and the obstruction piled up, rather than
built up, on the outer side; if so, it might be cleared away
without its removal being noticed inside the city until the
door was forced open.<a name="Anchor_184" id="Anchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 184.">[184]</a> In all likelihood Peter’s discovery of
this possible entrance had really been made as he passed the
outer side of the gate on his way to the castle, and the purpose
of his daring venture was to learn whether its inner side
was penetrable and unguarded. He found that it was so, and
having made his way back safely to his friends, gave orders
for the gate to be cleared out. His comrades of the host
came to meet him joyously, “every man in the ranks singing
as if the victory were already won”; Peter merrily told them
that when they had gained possession of the city he should
claim the bishop’s house for his own residence, as a reward
for having prepared them a safe way of entry.<a name="Anchor_185" id="Anchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 185.">[185]</a></p>

<p>Possibly, however, the lay leaders may have been unwilling
to stake the safety of their enterprise solely on the judgement
of their episcopal counsellor; for it seems that while Falkes
de Bréauté, with his own followers and all the cross-bowmen,
was sent into the castle, the main body of the host went round
to the north gate&mdash;the Roman “Porta Nova,” “New Port,”
now reduced to a single great arch with a smaller one at its
side, but in the Marshal’s day probably still almost complete
in the pristine strength of its solid Roman masonry, forming
an arched passage flanked by two smaller passages, some
twenty feet long,<a name="Anchor_186" id="Anchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 186.">[186]</a> and closed with heavy doors which the
Royalists set to work to batter in.<a name="Anchor_187" id="Anchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 187.">[187]</a> The French party were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
plying their engines vigorously on the castle when suddenly
they saw its walls and towers bristling with cross-bowmen;
and “as in the twinkling of an eye” a shower of quarrels,
aimed with deadly effect at the destriers of the besiegers,
reduced many knights and barons of high rank among them
to the condition of foot soldiers. The sight of their discomfiture
tempted Falkes to make a dash from the eastern gate
of the castle into their midst, with some of his personal
followers; he was, however, quickly surrounded and captured,
but was gallantly rescued by his men.<a name="Anchor_188" id="Anchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 188.">[188]</a> Bishop Peter meanwhile
was protesting to the Marshal against the folly&mdash;as he
deemed it&mdash;of trying to force an entrance elsewhere than at
the “safe” place where, as he said, there was an opening in
the wall ready for use, yet hidden from and unguarded by the
enemy. “By my head! those men are wrong; they have not
found the right way to get in. I will lead you to it; come
with me.” “By God’s sword! hither, my helmet!” was the
Marshal’s reply.<a name="Anchor_189" id="Anchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 189.">[189]</a> Peter however now held him back and
proposed that before risking a general assault two men from
each “battle” or division of the host should be sent to look
around for ambushes.<a name="Anchor_190" id="Anchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 190.">[190]</a> This was done; but the Marshal was
too impatient to await the result. He at once “put himself
forward on his way,” calling his own men to the onset:
“Forward! Now shall ye see your enemies vanquished in a
few hours; shame to him who longer delays!” Again Peter
tried to check him, begging him to wait till the whole host<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
could be reunited and the attack made in full force. The
aged warrior would not listen; “swifter than a merlin he
struck spurs into his horse, so that all who were with him
gathered hardihood as they beheld him.” A “valet” called
after him that he was, after all, going without his helmet;
“Stop here while I fetch it,” said the Marshal to his son. In
a moment he was back again, “and when he had thus covered
his head, he was goodly to look upon beyond all the rest&mdash;light
in movement as a bird, hawk or eaglet.” “Hungry lion
never rushed on its prey so hotly as the Marshal on his foes”;
at the first onset he dashed three spears’ length into their
midst, cutting his way through them and scattering them on
all sides, while Bishop Peter followed shouting “God help the
Marshal!”<a name="Anchor_191" id="Anchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 191.">[191]</a></p>

<p>By this time the stubborn attack on the north gate had
succeeded, and all the Royalist forces thus poured in at once
upon the besiegers of the castle,<a name="Anchor_192" id="Anchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 192.">[192]</a> who, although numerically
stronger, were unable to withstand their onset,<a name="Anchor_193" id="Anchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 193.">[193]</a> aided as it was
by the murderous fire which Falkes’s cross-bowmen, from their
vantage-ground on the castle wall, poured down upon the
horses of the French knights, the animals falling “like stuck
pigs” while the riders were captured without possibility of
rescue.<a name="Anchor_194" id="Anchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 194.">[194]</a> The French force is said to have consisted of six
hundred and eleven knights and full a thousand footmen;
it is not quite clear whether this reckoning includes their
English allies.<a name="Anchor_195" id="Anchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 195.">[195]</a> Yet, small as were the numbers engaged on
both sides, the fight lasted from between seven and eight
o’clock in the morning till nearly three in the afternoon.<a name="Anchor_196" id="Anchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 196.">[196]</a> It
was protracted partly by the stubborn persistence of the two
parties, who both alike felt that the destiny of England was
involved in its result, and partly by the impossibility, in the
steep and narrow streets of a city such as Lincoln, of bringing
it to a decisive issue in one general encounter. It thus became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
a battle of the old-world epic type, full of separate incidents
and individual encounters; and this peculiar character,
together with the extraordinarily small amount of actual
bloodshed and loss of life that took place in it, probably
suggested the name afterwards given to by the victors&mdash;“the
Tournament,” or as the word is commonly but in
this case perhaps less accurately rendered, “Fair of Lincoln.”<a name="Anchor_197" id="Anchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 197.">[197]</a></p>

<p>The first recorded incident was one of good omen for the
Royalists. Some of them found the enemy’s chief engineer<a name="Anchor_198" id="Anchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 198.">[198]</a>
working a stone-caster which hurled stones against one of the
towers of the castle. Mistaking the new-comers for knights
of his own party, he, all the more eagerly, placed a stone in
his machine, but as he was giving the signal for its discharge
they came up behind him and struck off his head.<a name="Anchor_199" id="Anchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 199.">[199]</a> The
Marshal and the Earl of Salisbury “turned to the right,
leaving a minster on their left,”<a name="Anchor_200" id="Anchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 200.">[200]</a> and came upon a cluster of
enemies, one of whom, Robert of Ropsley, levelled his spear
“to joust,” and struck that of Longsword with such force that
it shivered into fragments; but the Marshal gave him such a
blow between the shoulders that he fell to the ground “and
crawled away to hide himself.” The fight swept onward almost
to the brow of the hill on which the city was set, till on
a level space near the great minster,<a name="Anchor_201" id="Anchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 201.">[201]</a> the French made a
resolute stand under the direction of the Count of Perche.<a name="Anchor_202" id="Anchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 202.">[202]</a>
He was only a youth, of scarce two and twenty years,<a name="Anchor_203" id="Anchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 203.">[203]</a> “handsome,
tall, and noble-looking.”<a name="Anchor_204" id="Anchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 204.">[204]</a> He stood at bay as bravely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
as King Stephen had stood in somewhat like circumstances
in the earlier battle of Lincoln; and for a while he and his
men succeeded in checking the progress of the Royalists.
By degrees, however, the French lost ground and began to
fall back down the hill. Perche, with a few of his personal
followers, alone kept his post, and was at last surrounded by
almost the whole force of the English. They called upon
him to surrender, but he refused with an oath, saying he
would never yield to one of a race “who had been traitors to
their king.”<a name="Anchor_205" id="Anchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 205.">[205]</a> Reginald Croc, a knight of Falkes’s household,<a name="Anchor_206" id="Anchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 206.">[206]</a>
then levelled a spear at him and struck him in the eye.
The Marshal, coming up at that moment, seized the bridle of
the count’s horse, “and it seemed right, as the count was the
chief man on the French side.” Perche dropped the bridle,
took his sword in both hands, and struck with it on the
Marshal’s helmet three blows in quick succession, “so mighty
that they dinted it visibly,” and then suddenly fell from his
horse. The Marshal thought he had fainted, “and feared
that he himself should be blamed therefor.” “Dismount
and take off his helmet,” said one of Perche’s men, William of
Montigny, “for it hurts him; but I doubt he will stand up no
more.” Croc’s spear had in fact pierced through the eye to
the brain, and when the helmet was removed the friends and
foes who crowded round saw that the gallant youth was dead.<a name="Anchor_207" id="Anchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 207.">[207]</a></p>

<p>Perche’s comrades at once rushed down the hill<a name="Anchor_208" id="Anchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 208.">[208]</a> and rejoined
the bulk of the French troops, to whom his heroism and the
concentration of the English around his person had given a
breathing-space of which they had made good use. They
and their English allies had rallied in the lower town, and
now came, in close array, up the hill, hoping to regain
possession of its summit. Meanwhile the young Marshal
had rejoined his father. “Are you hurt?” asked the Earl.
“No, Sir.” <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>“Forward then! This day we will conquer, or
chase them from the field.” Attacked on their right flank by
Chester and his “good folk” before they reached the hill-top,
confronted when they did reach it by the Marshals, and shut
in between the minster and the castle, the French, after another
stubborn fight, were again driven down the slope; and
this time they were chased right out of the city and through
its southern gate, or Stone-Bow,<a name="Anchor_209" id="Anchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 209.">[209]</a> to Wigford Bridge.<a name="Anchor_210" id="Anchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 210.">[210]</a> There
they made a last gallant stand, fighting with such desperate
fury that “if God had spoken by thunder, He would not have
been heard.” Their pursuers were no less daring and impetuous:
William Bloet, the young Marshal’s standard-bearer,
charged into the crowd on the bridge with such vehemence
that he and his horse went sheer over into the river, only,
however, to struggle out again with equal quickness and
gallantry. Gradually the cry of “King’s men! King’s men!”<a name="Anchor_211" id="Anchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 211.">[211]</a>
rose higher above the din. Saer de Quincy and his son
Robert were taken; so was Robert FitzWalter; so were
several other rebel barons;<a name="Anchor_212" id="Anchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 212.">[212]</a> at last the rest turned and fled
across the suburb of Wigford by “the street which goes
straight to the hospital”<a name="Anchor_213" id="Anchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 213.">[213]</a>&mdash;in other words, the whole length of
the present High Street&mdash;till they reached the outer or furthermost
gate of Lincoln.<a name="Anchor_214" id="Anchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 214.">[214]</a> This gate, known as the Great or
Western Bar-Gate, protected the bridge by which the main
road from Lincoln to the south crossed the great drain called
the Sincil Dyke. Here the fugitives were checked by a
double obstacle. The bar of the gate was so constructed that
the gate closed of itself after every individual who passed in
or out. Just as the foremost of them reached it, a cow
tried to enter, and, the gate falling upon her, stuck fast, so
that egress was altogether impossible till the animal was slain;
and even then, as there was apparently no means of fixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
the gate open, each man as he came up had to dismount and
open it for himself.<a name="Anchor_215" id="Anchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 215.">[215]</a> The unhappy fugitives might, it seems,
have been captured or even slain almost to a man, had their
pursuers so willed it; but many of them were English, and
the ties of blood restrained their kinsmen in the royalist host
from carrying the pursuit to extremity.<a name="Anchor_216" id="Anchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 216.">[216]</a> Notwithstanding
this forbearance, however, a large number of prisoners were
captured.<a name="Anchor_217" id="Anchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 217.">[217]</a> Among these were nearly all the English barons
who had sided with Louis;<a name="Anchor_218" id="Anchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 218.">[218]</a> no less than seven were taken by
John Marshal, and several by Bishop Peter and his men;<a name="Anchor_219" id="Anchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 219.">[219]</a>
forty-six in all are named by contemporary historians;<a name="Anchor_220" id="Anchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 220.">[220]</a> and
the prisoners of knightly rank numbered three hundred,<a name="Anchor_221" id="Anchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 221.">[221]</a>
besides many others of lesser degree. Those who escaped
“stopped neither by night nor by day, in town or house, for
they thought that on every hill-side and in every dale the
bushes were all full of Marshals.”<a name="Anchor_222" id="Anchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 222.">[222]</a> Only three of the “great
men” among the French&mdash;Simon of Poissy, Hugh the
castellan of Arras, and Eustace de Merlinghem the constable
of Boulogne&mdash;reached London with some two hundred knights.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
The foot-soldiers were nearly all slain by the country folk who
came out “with swords and staves” to intercept their flight.<a name="Anchor_223" id="Anchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 223.">[223]</a>
In the actual battle only five men had been slain; on one
side the Count of Perche, two of his knights,<a name="Anchor_224" id="Anchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 224.">[224]</a> and a man-at-arms
whom no one recognized; on the other, Perche’s slayer,
Reginald Croc.<a name="Anchor_225" id="Anchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 225.">[225]</a></p>

<p>Unhappily, the English sullied their victory by sacking
Lincoln. Not content with seizing the baggage and valuable
goods of the French nobles and the rebel barons, which they
found piled up in waggons in some of the streets, they
“despoiled the whole city, even to the uttermost farthing”;
and on the strength of Gualo’s exhortation to treat the
canons of the cathedral chapter as excommunicate (owing to
their having been throughout the war in opposition to the
King), they plundered every church, breaking open chests and
presses and carrying off plate, jewels, vestments, and money;
the precentor of the cathedral lost eleven thousand marks.
Many women fled from the city with their children and household
goods, and sought to escape in boats, but through their
overcrowding and ignorance of rowing all the little vessels
capsized, the occupants were drowned, and the goods became
the prize of anyone who fished them up from the bottom of
the river.<a name="Anchor_226" id="Anchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 226.">[226]</a> All these things were done after the Marshal had
left the city. As soon as the fight was over he and the other
leaders held a council to consider what they should do next.
Some were for marching on London, some for trying to
dislodge Louis from Dover. As they could not agree, the
Marshal with his usual practical good sense bade them all go
home and place their respective prisoners in safety, and meet
him again, with the Legate, on a day which he named, at
Chertsey,<a name="Anchor_227" id="Anchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 227.">[227]</a> or, according to another account, at Oxford.<a name="Anchor_228" id="Anchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 228.">[228]</a> He
then, without stopping even to eat, hurried with his tidings of
victory to the King and the Legate at Nottingham. Thither,
next morning<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>Trinity Sunday, 21 May<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>, came news of another gain to the royal cause;
the garrison of Mountsorel, whose constable, Henry de
Braybroke, had gone with Saer de Quincy to Lincoln, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
fled and left the castle deserted.<a name="Anchor_229" id="Anchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 229.">[229]</a> The Earl of Salisbury
appears to have been sent to secure it for the King; two days
later<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>23 May<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> an order was issued to him from Lincoln, in the King’s
name, to deliver it to Earl Ranulf of Chester,<a name="Anchor_230" id="Anchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 230.">[230]</a> who forthwith
razed it to the ground.<a name="Anchor_231" id="Anchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 231.">[231]</a></p>

<p>On Thursday, 25th May,<a name="Anchor_232" id="Anchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 232.">[232]</a> the news of the Fair of Lincoln
reached Louis in his camp before Dover. He took counsel
with his friends; and they all agreed that he must raise the
siege, concentrate in London, and send to France for reinforcements.
Unwillingly he caused his trebuchet to be taken
down, and prepared to withdraw, but determined to stay over
Sunday 28th, “to see whether he would get any news.” On
the Sunday “it was very clear at sea, and looking towards
Calais they saw many ships with their sails set, whereof they
rejoiced greatly.” Next day<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>29 May<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> the ships “came sailing over the
sea right merrily, to the number of full six score.” The
English, when they saw them, hoisted their sails and put to
sea; the French set off in chase, but finding they could not
catch them put about again and made straight for Dover.
The English then put about likewise, overtook the hindermost
ships of the French fleet, and captured eight of them; the rest
got safe into the harbour, and were met by Louis on the
beach. To his great disappointment and rage, however, he
found that, except one large vessel in which were eighteen
knights, they brought nothing but sailors, merchants, and
men-at-arms. Next day<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>30 May<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> he sent them all back again, with
two messengers charged with letters to his father. Then
he set fire to “all the ships which were ashore before the
haven,” and betook himself to Canterbury and thence to
London, where he arrived on Thursday, 1st June.<a name="Anchor_233" id="Anchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 233.">[233]</a></p>

<p>The Royalists meanwhile had advanced by way of Windsor
and Staines to Chertsey;<a name="Anchor_234" id="Anchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 234.">[234]</a> thence they made secret overtures to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
some of the leading citizens of London for the surrender of
the city. Tempted on the one hand by the promise of a
confirmation of its liberties “under the King’s seal,” and
terrified on the other hand by the fate of Lincoln, London
was clearly beginning to waver; and Louis, on discovering
these secret negotiations, could only secure himself in the
city by closing all its gates save one and insisting upon a
renewal of homage from the citizens to himself.<a name="Anchor_235" id="Anchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 235.">[235]</a> At the
beginning of June the Archbishop of Tyre, who had come to
Europe to preach a crusade, arrived in England from France,
accompanied by the abbots of Citeaux, Clairvaux, and
Pontigny, and endeavoured to reconcile the contending
parties.<a name="Anchor_236" id="Anchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 236.">[236]</a> Several parleys were held,<a name="Anchor_237" id="Anchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 237.">[237]</a> and a draft treaty was
actually prepared<a name="Anchor_238" id="Anchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 238.">[238]</a> and seems to have been discussed between
four of Louis’s counsellors and four of Henry’s, who met,
accompanied by twenty knights of each party, between
Brentford and Hounslow,<a name="Anchor_239" id="Anchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 239.">[239]</a> on 13th June. But the meeting
proved useless because Louis insisted upon including in the
peace four clerks whose conduct had been, alike in an
ecclesiastical and a political point of view, so outrageous that
the Legate absolutely refused to admit them to any terms
without previously consulting the Pope.<a name="Anchor_240" id="Anchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 240.">[240]</a> The unsuccessful
mediators returned to France at the end of the month.<a name="Anchor_241" id="Anchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 241.">[241]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Falkes de Bréauté had taken Lynn.<a name="Anchor_242" id="Anchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 242.">[242]</a> On 23rd
June the sheriffs were ordered to publish the Charter in their
shires and see that it was put in execution.<a name="Anchor_243" id="Anchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 243.">[243]</a> The King and
his council then withdrew to Gloucester;<a name="Anchor_244" id="Anchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 244.">[244]</a> and it was
probably during their temporary absence from the neighbourhood
of London that Louis sent the Viscount of Melun and
Eustace de Neville on a plundering raid into East Anglia,
whence they returned laden with the spoils of the famous
abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund.<a name="Anchor_245" id="Anchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 245.">[245]</a></p>

<p>This raid was evidently a desperate expedient for obtaining
supplies. Cooped up in London, Louis and his men were in
need of everything; and Philip Augustus shewed no
inclination to send them help of any kind.<a name="Anchor_246" id="Anchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 246.">[246]</a> Months before, if
we may believe the Marshal’s biographer, the French King,
when he heard that John was dead, his son crowned, and the
Marshal in charge of the realm, had declared that further
effort was useless. “We shall take nothing in England now;
that brave man’s good sense will defend the land&mdash;Louis has
lost it. Mark my words! When the Marshal takes the matter
in hand, we are undone.”<a name="Anchor_247" id="Anchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 247.">[247]</a> As Philip had from the outset
refused to countenance his son’s enterprise openly, so now he
connived at, rather than assisted, the efforts of his daughter-in-law,
Blanche of Castille, to collect money and troops for
Louis.<a name="Anchor_248" id="Anchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 248.">[248]</a> Blanche scoured the country in her husband’s behalf,
pleading his cause so energetically that a contemporary says,
“if those whom she enlisted had all gone to England in arms,
they might have conquered the whole kingdom.”<a name="Anchor_249" id="Anchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 249.">[249]</a> The
force which her efforts finally brought together at Calais
numbered, however, only about a hundred&mdash;or at the utmost
three hundred&mdash;knights.<a name="Anchor_250" id="Anchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 250.">[250]</a> Several times, while they lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
encamped on the shore, some English ships sailed up to the
harbour and discharged arrows at them; and once, at least, a
great fight took place, in which the English were signally
worsted. Another night the French actually crossed the
Channel and anchored off Dover, intending to sail thence round
to the mouth of the Thames; but in the morning, as they
were about to set forth, a storm overtook them and drove
them back panic-stricken to the coast of Flanders.<a name="Anchor_251" id="Anchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 251.">[251]</a></p>

<p>On 4th July the King’s guardians issued from Gloucester a
summons for a council to be held at Oxford on the 15th. It
seems not to have actually met till a week later; and on 26th
or 27th July the King and the Marshal returned to Gloucester,
after issuing (22nd July) a summons for another assembly to
be held at Oxford on 6th August.<a name="Anchor_252" id="Anchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 252.">[252]</a> The royal forces were
increasing more and more. Two great nobles had joined
them since Louis’s return to England&mdash;the Earl of Warren
before 22nd June, and the Earl of Arundel before 14th July<a name="Anchor_253" id="Anchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 253.">[253]</a>&mdash;and
nearly one hundred and fifty rebels submitted between
the end of May and the beginning of August.<a name="Anchor_254" id="Anchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 254.">[254]</a> When the
host re-assembled at Oxford<a name="Anchor_255" id="Anchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 255.">[255]</a> all was ready for the final
struggle. From Oxford they moved to Reading, and thence
to Farnham;<a name="Anchor_256" id="Anchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 256.">[256]</a> there, it seems, the leaders separated, the
Legate and the King going northward again with one part
towards London, while another part under the Earl Marshal
and the justiciar made for the Kentish coast to prepare for its
defence against the expected French fleet.</p>

<p>From Dover the Marshal summoned the men of the
Cinque Ports to arm and assemble their ships at Sandwich.
The aged warrior was eager to go forth in person and
encounter the French at sea, but his men would not suffer
it; he must stay on shore, they said, “for if it chanced that
he were slain or captured, who then would defend the
land?”<a name="Anchor_257" id="Anchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 257.">[257]</a> On <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bartholomew’s eve<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>Wed., 23 Aug.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> he, with the Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Warren, King John’s elder son Richard,<a name="Anchor_258" id="Anchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 258.">[258]</a> Philip d’Aubigné,
and a host of other “good knights,” lay encamped near
Canterbury. They “slept little,” for they all knew that
the morrow might prove a day almost as momentous as that
of Senlac. At early dawn<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>24 Aug.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> they marched to Sandwich. The
day broke clear and bright, with a “soft and pleasant” wind
which soon brought into view the armament coming from
Calais.<a name="Anchor_259" id="Anchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 259.">[259]</a> It consisted of some eighty vessels of various sizes;<a name="Anchor_260" id="Anchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 260.">[260]</a>
ten of them were large ships of war, fully armed,<a name="Anchor_261" id="Anchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 261.">[261]</a> of which four
were filled with knights and six with men-at-arms; the smaller
vessels carried accoutrements and other goods.<a name="Anchor_262" id="Anchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 262.">[262]</a> Among the
knights were some of the noblest and bravest men of France;<a name="Anchor_263" id="Anchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 263.">[263]</a>
those of highest rank and fame, thirty-six in number, together
with the treasure which Blanche was sending to her husband,
were in the ship of Eustace the Monk, who seems to have been
in command of the whole fleet.<a name="Anchor_264" id="Anchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 264.">[264]</a> The vessels were making for
the mouth of the Thames,<a name="Anchor_265" id="Anchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 265.">[265]</a> and as they swept round Thanet in
close array as if ready for a fight, Eustace’s ship leading,<a name="Anchor_266" id="Anchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 266.">[266]</a> their
number and character could be plainly distinguished by the
Royalists drawn up on the shore, as well as by the sailors
who manned the English ships in Sandwich harbour.<a name="Anchor_267" id="Anchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 267.">[267]</a></p>

<p>At the eleventh hour the Marshal’s plan of campaign all
but broke down. The English fleet was ready; but it
comprised only eighteen, or at the utmost twenty-two, ships
of any size, with some smaller ones to the number of about
twenty more;<a name="Anchor_268" id="Anchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 268.">[268]</a> and the sight of the enemy’s superior fleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
struck such terror into the sailors that they lost their heads
completely, left their ships with the sails all hoisted, and
took refuge in their little boats.<a name="Anchor_269" id="Anchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 269.">[269]</a> Once more the Marshal
appealed to them as only he could appeal. Again he offered
to go with them; but again his own men forbade it.<a name="Anchor_270" id="Anchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 270.">[270]</a> Then
by a characteristic exhortation he shamed the mariners out
of their fears. “God has given us one victory over the
French on land. Now they are coming again, to claim the
country against Him. But He has power to help the good
on sea as well as on shore,<a name="Anchor_271" id="Anchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 271.">[271]</a> and He will help His own. You
have the advantage in the game; you will conquer the enemies
of God!”<a name="Anchor_272" id="Anchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 272.">[272]</a> The impressionable sailors caught a new spirit
from the landsmen who, fresh from their victory over superior
numbers at Lincoln, were fearless of the risk of another
encounter at similar odds.<a name="Anchor_273" id="Anchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 273.">[273]</a> One ship was quickly filled with
the Marshal’s own followers, under his nephew John;<a name="Anchor_274" id="Anchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 274.">[274]</a>
Richard the King’s son went on board another with a
company of knights;<a name="Anchor_275" id="Anchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 275.">[275]</a> a third was occupied by Earl Warren’s
men, the Earl himself remaining on shore with the Marshal;<a name="Anchor_276" id="Anchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 276.">[276]</a>
Philip d’Aubigné probably commanded a contingent from
the Channel Isles. Hubert de Burgh seems to have joined
the muster by sea, coming from Dover in “a fine ship” of his
own,<a name="Anchor_277" id="Anchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 277.">[277]</a> and to have taken the supreme command.</p>

<p>The skill and energy of the English sailors quickly atoned
for their momentary panic. Though wind and tide were both
against them,<a name="Anchor_278" id="Anchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 278.">[278]</a> they came up in the rear of the French fleet just
as it reached the mouth of the estuary. For a moment the
leading English ship&mdash;that of Hubert&mdash;seemed about to close
with the enemy; then it suddenly shot forward, as if the
commander’s purpose were not to give battle, but to avoid it.<a name="Anchor_279" id="Anchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 279.">[279]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
On seeing this, the French shifted their sails, and with insulting
cries of “<i>La hart! la hart!</i>”&mdash;a call with which
huntsmen were wont to urge their hounds after the quarry&mdash;turned
round to the attack, their line still headed by the
ship of Eustace the Monk.<a name="Anchor_280" id="Anchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 280.">[280]</a> This was probably the largest
and most formidable vessel of the French fleet; but it was
overloaded; it carried, besides its freight of men and treasure,
some valuable horses for Louis, and a trebuchet; and in
consequence, it lay so deep in the water that the waves
almost overflowed its deck. Sir Richard the King’s son laid
his ship alongside it at once; Earl Warren’s men quickly
brought up their ship on its other side. This latter ship was
only a cog, or fishing vessel; but being light it stood high
above the water, and its occupants were thus able to cast
down potfuls of lime and stones on their adversaries’ heads,
with blinding if not deadly effect.<a name="Anchor_281" id="Anchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 281.">[281]</a> Meanwhile the armed
galleys of the English fleet, few though they were in number,
were doing fatal execution on some of the other French ships,
piercing them with their iron beaks and sinking them. Now,
too, the French had the wind in their teeth, and it carried into
their faces clouds of quicklime thrown up into the air by the
English. Moreover, Philip d’Aubigné had with him a
company of crossbowmen whose arrows wrought havoc
among the enemy.<a name="Anchor_282" id="Anchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 282.">[282]</a> At length a man-at-arms from Guernsey,
Reginald Payne, leaped from the deck of the cog to that of
Eustace’s ship with such an impetus that in alighting he
knocked down a French knight, William des Barres; in
another moment he had prostrated a second foeman of rank
and disabled a third; amid the confusion thus created all
the fighting men on the cog followed him, and Eustace’s
ship was captured with all on board.<a name="Anchor_283" id="Anchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 283.">[283]</a> On seeing this the
remaining French ships took to flight. The victors chased
them all the way back to Calais.<a name="Anchor_284" id="Anchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 284.">[284]</a> Only fifteen vessels&mdash;the
largest in the fleet except that of Eustace&mdash;reached the
harbour; of the lesser ones many were taken<a name="Anchor_285" id="Anchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 285.">[285]</a> and the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
sunk.<a name="Anchor_286" id="Anchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 286.">[286]</a> The slaughter was frightful; only thirty-two men, all
of high rank and renown, were retained as prisoners on the
ship which had belonged to Eustace, and even these were
with difficulty saved by the English knights from the fury
of the men-at-arms and sailors whose valour had won that
great prize.<a name="Anchor_287" id="Anchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 287.">[287]</a> On every other captured vessel only a man or
two were left alive; the rest were slain and “flung to the
fishes for food.”<a name="Anchor_288" id="Anchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 288.">[288]</a></p>

<p>When the fight and the chase were over and the prizes all
towed into Sandwich, one prisoner was missed: Eustace the
Monk. After a long search he was found hiding in the hold
of his ship<a name="Anchor_289" id="Anchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 289.">[289]</a> from the universal hatred of which he knew
himself to be the object, not only as the commander of the
hostile fleet, but still more as a traitor of the deepest dye and
a man of infamous character in every respect. He offered to
give his captors ten thousand marks and to serve King
Henry faithfully if they would grant him his life, “but it could
not be.” One Stephen, a seaman of Winchelsea, who had
sailed with him in earlier days when he was in the service of
King John, flung in his face a recital of all his misdoings on
land and sea, and bade him choose whether to have his head
cut off on the ship’s deck or on the trebuchet. “Neither
alternative was sweet,” says a contemporary writer with grim
sarcasm; “anyway, they cut off his head. That was his
festival day.”<a name="Anchor_290" id="Anchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 290.">[290]</a> The severed head was afterwards stuck on
the point of a spear and carried round the neighbourhood, to
shew the people, who had long lived in terror of the ruthless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
freebooter, that he was really dead.<a name="Anchor_291" id="Anchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 291.">[291]</a> The prisoners were sent
to Dover to be put in ward in the castle under the charge of
Hubert;<a name="Anchor_292" id="Anchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 292.">[292]</a> Philip d’Aubigné was despatched to carry news of
the victory to the Legate and the King;<a name="Anchor_293" id="Anchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 293.">[293]</a> the Marshal stayed
to superintend the division of the spoils. There was a large
quantity of valuable things, money, plate, clothes, horses,
arms, harness, provisions of various kinds; the Marshal
contrived to distribute these in such a way that every man
thought his own share better than that of his fellows, and yet
to leave a residue which, with the hearty assent of the sailors,
he devoted to the foundation of a hospital for “God’s poor,”
in honour of the Saint on whose festival day the victory had
been won.<a name="Anchor_294" id="Anchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 294.">[294]</a></p>

<p>The Fair of Lincoln had, as a contemporary writer
emphatically says, “destroyed the [rebel] barons.”<a name="Anchor_295" id="Anchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 295.">[295]</a> It had
deprived Louis of the bulk of his English allies, and left the
French conquest of England to be accomplished, if accomplished
at all, solely by French hands. Had the French
reinforcements effected a landing and defeated the Royalists
in one battle, such a conquest might still have been possible.
But when the tidings of that <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bartholomew’s day reached
Louis, he at once saw that his cause was lost.<a name="Anchor_296" id="Anchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 296.">[296]</a> While the
Marshal’s division of the English host was in Kent, the other
division, with the Legate and the young King, had encamped
round about London, more closely than the Royalists had yet
approached the capital since Louis’s return. Gualo seems to
have placed Henry with his mother in the safe shelter of
Windsor castle while he himself ventured as near to London
as Kingston; one day, however, a report reached him that
the French were sallying forth to attack him, whereupon he
rode hastily back to Windsor. This French sally may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
been the “very fine raid, wherein the lesser folk won much
gain,” which is said to have been made about this time by the
young Duke of Brittany. Again there was ineffectual talk
of peace. Then the Legate proposed a siege of the city; but
for this the lay leaders deemed their forces insufficient, and
they retired each man to his own quarters. Another
unsuccessful attempt at pacification, made by a Cistercian
monk who was one of the Pope’s penitentiaries, was followed
by a meeting of the Queen-mother and the Count of Nevers,
between Windsor and London; “they spoke amicably, and
parted amicably, but without making peace.” Louis was so
conscious of peril that he removed from the bishop’s house to
the Tower, “to be more in safety.”<a name="Anchor_297" id="Anchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 297.">[297]</a> The news of the battle of
Sandwich reached him late on the evening of Saturday, 26th
August. On Monday, 28th, Robert of Dreux went under a safe-conduct
from the King to speak with the Marshal at Rochester;
next day one of the newly-captured French knights, Robert de
Courtenay, was allowed to go to London to speak with Louis,
Dreux remaining as a hostage in his stead.<a name="Anchor_298" id="Anchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 298.">[298]</a> After consulting
with Courtenay and others, Louis decided to ask for a parley
with William the Marshal in person.<a name="Anchor_299" id="Anchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 299.">[299]</a></p>

<p>William took counsel with the other Royalists; “and there
were some who spoke rightly bravely, though they had kept
away from the coast in the hour of need.” These men said:
“We do not want to conciliate Louis. The only parley we
want is a siege of London.” But the valiant men who had
been in the fight were wiser; they besought the Marshal to
get the French out of the country “and not to let lack of
money be a hindrance, for they would help him to the utmost
of their power, with their hearts and bodies and possessions.”
He therefore agreed to go and parley with Louis.<a name="Anchor_300" id="Anchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 300.">[300]</a> He took
with him, however, all the Royalists who had accompanied
him into Kent; and the whole English host, thus reunited,
now blockaded the city by land, while on 1st September the
“barons” of the Cinque Ports were bidden to bring all their
ships to the mouth of the Thames for the King’s service,<a name="Anchor_301" id="Anchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 301.">[301]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
thus cutting off the capital from all chance of communication
by sea. It was obvious that if Louis did not make terms at
once, he would speedily be starved into unconditional
surrender.<a name="Anchor_302" id="Anchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 302.">[302]</a> He took a course which was not only safer, but
also more honourable both for himself and his adversaries,
when he met the Marshal and the Justiciar in conference
outside London<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>5 Sept.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>. He frankly committed himself into their
hands and those of the Legate, requesting them to dictate
their own terms, on the sole condition that those terms should
be such as would neither dishonour him nor offend his
companions in arms.<a name="Anchor_303" id="Anchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 303.">[303]</a></p>

<p>The Marshal and the Justiciar returned to Windsor, and
Louis to London. From that night&mdash;Tuesday, 5th
September&mdash;till Saturday, 9th, he waited in vain for their
expected propositions; then, on the advice of his barons,
he determined to make a sally early next morning and try
to cut his way out. Late on the Saturday night<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>9 Sept.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>, however,
as they were about to separate and make their preparations
for the morrow’s venture, a letter was brought to him from
the Marshal asking for a day’s truce and requesting that
Hugh de Malaunay might be sent to speak with the
Marshal and the council. Both these requests Louis granted.
A parley was then fixed for Tuesday (12th September), and
a prolongation of the truce till Thursday (14th) was guaranteed
by the Queen, the two William Marshals, the Earls of
Salisbury, Warren, and Arundel, and some other magnates.
Malaunay returned on Monday, 11th, and “told Louis what
he had got.”<a name="Anchor_304" id="Anchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 304.">[304]</a> It was evidently something of great importance,
for Louis at once “summoned his whole council, and the
barons of England who held with him, and the citizens, and
asked their advice upon it; and they all approved it.”<a name="Anchor_305" id="Anchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 305.">[305]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>What Malaunay had brought was evidently the definite
offer of terms for which Louis had asked. Louis had put
himself&mdash;“saving his honour”&mdash;into the hands of the King’s
guardians; “therefore,” as a contemporary English historian
says, “they, with whom the whole matter rested, and who
desired above all things to get rid of Louis, sent back to him
a certain form of peace drawn up in writing;<a name="Anchor_306" id="Anchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 306.">[306]</a> to which if he
consented, they would undertake to secure for him and his
adherents a safe departure from England; if not, they would
use their utmost efforts to compass his ruin.”<a name="Anchor_307" id="Anchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 307.">[307]</a> The terms
which they offered seem to have been these: The adherents
and allies of Louis in England, Henry and his adherents,
London and the other towns, were all to have their respective
rights and lands as they had them at the beginning of the
war. (A later clause explained that this provision was not
to apply to clerks, except as regards lay fees held by them.)
Prisoners on both sides, taken since Louis’s coming to
England, to be set free; those taken earlier, to be released
if three persons, to be chosen by Henry’s council from the
council of Louis, should swear that they were Louis’s men
on the day of their capture; for all prisoners, ransoms
already paid to be kept; ransoms now due to be paid;
ransoms not yet due to be remitted; and all disputes to be
settled by the aforesaid three. All English prisoners, and
other English subjects who were in arms against King John,
to give security for their fidelity to Henry, by homage, oaths,
and charters, according to the custom of England. Money
for the payment of which hostages had been given to Louis
was to be paid at once, if the date fixed for the payment had
arrived, and the hostages were to be restored. All cities,
lands, and other property which had been forcibly occupied
in England were to be restored to the King or other owners.
Louis was to send letters to the brothers of Eustace the
Monk bidding them restore to Henry the islands (some of
the Channel Isles) which Eustace had seized; if they failed
to do so, Louis was to distrain the lands which they held of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
him; and if they were then still contumacious, they were to be
outside this peace. Louis and Henry were each to send a copy
of the peace to King Alexander of Scotland, and he, if he
wished to be included in it, was to restore all castles, lands,
and prisoners, taken by him during the war. Louis was to
send a copy, on the same conditions, to Llywelyn and the
other Welsh princes. Louis was to quit-claim to all the
barons and men of England all homage, fealty, confederations,
and alliances, and never henceforth to make, on account of
this war, any confederation which might at any time cause
damage to the English King. The barons of England were
to swear to Henry that they would enter into no confederation
or undertaking against him or his heirs, with Louis or with
any other person. Louis was to take his corporal oath, and
his men with him, and such of them as the King’s council
should choose were also to pledge themselves individually by
charters, that they would keep this peace firmly and faithfully;
and Louis was to do his utmost to obtain confirmation
of it from the Pope.<a name="Anchor_308" id="Anchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 308.">[308]</a> All debts now due to Louis were to
be paid.<a name="Anchor_309" id="Anchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 309.">[309]</a></p>

<p>Well might Louis and his counsellors “all approve” this
draft treaty. Even if it was not&mdash;as in all likelihood it was&mdash;accompanied
by a verbal intimation of the Marshal’s willingness
to pay Louis an indemnity in money, still the terms
were much less hard than they had expected.<a name="Anchor_310" id="Anchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 310.">[310]</a> The issue of
the next day’s conference was now a foregone conclusion.<a name="Anchor_311" id="Anchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 311.">[311]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
The meeting took place in an islet in the Thames, opposite
Kingston.<a name="Anchor_312" id="Anchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 312.">[312]</a> The Royalists drew up on one side of the river,
the French on the other. Louis and his counsellors entered
a boat and were rowed to the island, where they found the
Queen, with the Legate “clad all in scarlet,” the Marshal,
and the other members of the English King’s council, as
well as the King himself.<a name="Anchor_313" id="Anchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 313.">[313]</a> Louis and his men swore on the
Gospels, first of all, that they would stand to the judgement
of the Church and be faithful to Church and Pope from that
day forward.<a name="Anchor_314" id="Anchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 314.">[314]</a> Then they swore to the conditions of peace
already set forth,<a name="Anchor_315" id="Anchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 315.">[315]</a> Louis adding a promise that he would, if
possible, induce his father to restore to Henry his rights
beyond the sea. Henry then laid his hand on the Book, and,
together with the Legate and the Marshal, made oath to
restore to the barons of England and all other men of the
realm all their rights and heritages, with all the liberties
formerly demanded, for which the discord between John and
the barons had arisen.<a name="Anchor_316" id="Anchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 316.">[316]</a> Lastly, an indemnity of (seemingly)
ten thousand marks was promised to Louis, for which the
Earl Marshal made himself personally responsible.<a name="Anchor_317" id="Anchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 317.">[317]</a></p>

<p>Thus, on Tuesday, September 12th,<a name="Anchor_318" id="Anchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 318.">[318]</a> the peace was made.
The absolution of Louis and his followers was deferred till
next day, because the prelates had not brought their “chapels”
with them,<a name="Anchor_319" id="Anchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 319.">[319]</a> and also because Gualo declared that Louis should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
have no absolution unless he would come “barefooted and
shirtless, clothed in a woollen gown”&mdash;the proper garb of a
penitent. The Frenchmen however begged hard that their
lord might be suffered to come with his woollen gown hidden
under his robe; and to this Gualo consented.<a name="Anchor_320" id="Anchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 320.">[320]</a> Both parties
returned to their lodgings for the night. Next day<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>Wed., 13 Sept.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> the Legate
and the bishops put on their silken copes and their mitres
and absolved Louis and all his men, except the four clerks
specially reserved for the judgement of the Pope,<a name="Anchor_321" id="Anchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 321.">[321]</a> who were
made to withdraw from the island while the absolution was
taking place. Gualo then sent the Pope’s penitentiary to
London to absolve the citizens and others who had not been
present at the conference.<a name="Anchor_322" id="Anchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 322.">[322]</a> On Thursday, September 14th,
the conclusion of the peace was formally announced in the
King’s name.<a name="Anchor_323" id="Anchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 323.">[323]</a> On Sunday, 17th, the Legate went to Merton
priory, and next day<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>18 Sept.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> the peace was confirmed there, on the
one part by Louis with the Counts of Britanny, Nevers, and
Dreux, and “many others from France,” on the other part by
the Queen with many English bishops, earls, barons, and
knights. On the 22nd Louis came to Merton again, to receive
from the Legate’s penitentiary injunctions about his penance.<a name="Anchor_324" id="Anchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 324.">[324]</a>
After this he was escorted to Dover by the Legate, the
Marshal, and other magnates,<a name="Anchor_325" id="Anchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 325.">[325]</a> and sailed for France on
Michaelmas eve.<a name="Anchor_326" id="Anchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 326.">[326]</a></p>

however, they all mean merely what is expressly, though awkwardly, stated by
the Merton chronicler&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coronatus ... a domino Syvalone legato ...

and more clearly by the Barnwell annalist: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Imposuit autem ei manus

<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 48)</cite> that he was crowned by Gualo’s authority, but by the hands of the Bishops
of Winchester, Worcester, and Exeter. Wykes’s account of the coronation is
obviously fantastic, except in one detail, that of the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sertum quoddam</span>,” which
is no doubt correct, as certainly no real crown could be available.

regis mentio fieret, impetraverunt qui apud Dovram obsessi erant inducias usque

authorities clearly show that though hostilities were suspended before John’s
death, the siege was not actually raised till the beginning of November. Mr. G.
J. Turner appears to have overlooked this fact when he wrote that Hubert’s
absence from the coronation “excites some suspicion concerning his loyalty”
(<cite>“Minority of Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>,” part <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>, <i><abbr title="Transactions of the Royal Historical Society">Trans. Roy. Hist. Soc.</abbr></i>, 2nd Series, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="18">xviii.</abbr>,

leave Dover till his truce with Louis was prolonged and the siege raised.

Norwich castle is said by Roger of Wendover (<cite id="Footnote_81a"><abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="3">iii.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 378–9</cite>) to have
been “found empty” and garrisoned by Louis before John’s death; but this is
a very unlikely story. Without discussing objections in detail, it is enough to
say that in the French expedition into East Anglia (<cite><abbr title="Roger of Wendover">R. Wend.</abbr>, <i><a href="#Footnote_81a" title="Go to citation in Footnote 81.">l.c.</a></i></cite>, <cite><abbr title="Matthew">M.</abbr> Paris,

have been made, Louis had in reality no personal share at all, being at the time
busy winning castles in Hampshire; and that the expedition was clearly a mere

The Barnwell Annalist (<cite><abbr title="Walter of Coventry">W. Cov.</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 236) says, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sabbato quo finiendae
erant treugae applicuit Lodowicus apud Sandwich.</span>” The day on which the truce
would end, if the “month after Easter” (see above, <a href="#Page_19" title="Go to page 19.">p. 19</a>), meant a calendar
month, would be 26th April, and not Saturday but Wednesday. But a month of
four weeks from Easter would expire on Saturday, 22nd April; and this interpretation
is confirmed by the <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire des Ducs de Normandie">Hist. Ducs</abbr></i> (<i><a href="#Footnote_133" title="Go to citation in Footnote 133.">l.c.</a></i>)</cite>, one <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> of which says Louis sailed

is whether Louis sailed on the night of Friday, 21st April, and landed on Saturday,
22nd, or sailed on Saturday, 22nd, and landed on Sunday, 23rd. As the preponderance
of evidence seems to be in favour of the latter view, I have based my
reckoning of the dates of his subsequent movements on the assumption of its
correctness.

From <cite id="Footnote_148a"><abbr title="Roger of Wendover">R. Wend.</abbr>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 15</cite>, we should suppose that Saer’s appeal to
Louis was made in London; but the <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire des Ducs de Normandie">Hist. Ducs</abbr></i>, <i><a href="#Footnote_144a" title="Go to citation in Footnote 144.">l.c.</a></i></cite>, shows that it was made
at Farnham. On the other hand, the Flemish chronicler represents Saer as
departing straightway from Farnham for Mountsorel “on the morrow,” <i>i.e.</i>
Saturday, 29 April, “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">o grant chevalerie d’Englois</span>” and some seventy French
knights (<cite><abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 190, 191</cite>); while Roger says the relieving force&mdash;which he makes to
consist of six hundred knights and more than twenty thousand men-at-arms&mdash;started
from London “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pridie kalendas Maii, id est die Lunae proximo ante
Ascensionem Domini</span>” (<cite><i><a href="#Footnote_148a" title="Go to citation in Footnote 148.">l.c.</a></i></cite>). The last day of April, 1217, was Sunday, not
Monday. I think we may combine the two accounts, and assume that Saer
left Farnham on April 29 to go not directly towards Leicestershire, but to
London. The journey thither, and the necessary preparations after he had joined
his associates there, must have taken a couple of days, and the combined forces
could hardly set out before Monday, 1 May. The <cite><i><abbr title="Annals of Dunstable">Ann. Dunst.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 49</cite>, say the
relieving force consisted of “the barons who were at London,” the Count of
Perche, the Marshal of France, and ten thousand <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">armati</span></i> whom Louis had given
them. The <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="L’Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal">Hist. G. le Mar.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="lines">ll.</abbr> 16085–92</cite>, which says the party set out from
Winchester at the same time that Louis and the rest of his forces returned thence
to London, is obviously quite wrong.

time: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Item, Dominus Ludovicus reddat Domino Regi rotulos de Scaccario,

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> coronation of Henry <abbr title="the Third">III</abbr> had brought England face to
face with a problem which was practically new in her history:
the problem of a royal minority. In the days before the
Norman Conquest, indeed, three English kings had been
crowned before they reached the age which for men of lower
degree was counted as that of legal majority; and the last of
these three, Æthelred the Redeless, had come to his throne at
almost the same age as Henry. But these cases were all too
remote to furnish precedents for the guidance of the statesmen
into whose hands the task of carrying on the government of
England was thrown by the death of John. They could not
even furnish a precedent for the choice of a regent; and the
choice actually made was the result of circumstances which
may without exaggeration be called unique. None of the
known rules of English law concerning wardship were altogether
applicable to the case of the Crown. As the law of
England then stood, the wardship of a free tenement held by
other than military tenure, and of its infant heir, belonged to
the infant’s next-of-kin who was not capable of inheriting the
tenement; the wardship of an infant tenant in chivalry, and
of his land, belonged to his overlord. If the analogy of the
former case were to be followed, the regency would have
fallen to the King’s mother, Isabel of Angoulême. Not only,
however, was the task, in the circumstances then existing, far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
too weighty to be laid upon a woman and a foreigner, but it
was obviously impossible to treat the crown and realm of
England as a mere ordinary socage tenement. Wardship in
chivalry, on the other hand, would until little more than
three years before Henry’s accession have supplied no analogy
at all; for the King and kingdom of England had no overlord
upon earth before John’s homage to the Pope in May, 1213. By
virtue of that homage England became a fief of the Roman
see, and consequently on John’s death the wardship of his
youthful heir and his distracted realm vested legally in Pope
Honorius <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> It might therefore have been expected that
the regency would be at once assumed by the Pope’s representative
in England, the Legate Gualo. But Gualo was an
Italian who had been scarcely fifteen months in the land, and
he was a priest. The needs of the time imperatively demanded
that the acting head of the state, whose first task must be to
drive out an alien invader and bring back rebels to allegiance,
should be an Englishman and a warrior; and Gualo’s conduct
showed that neither he nor Honorius ever contemplated any
other arrangement. In all the transactions connected with
the crowning of the new King and the organization of the new
government the Legate seems to have purposely kept himself
as much as possible in the background, guarding the rights of
the Pope and the interests of the Pope’s ward not by direct
intervention but rather by his mere presence, and putting forth
his official powers only when their exercise was required to
confirm, by the Papal sanction given through him, the
measures agreed upon by the great men of the land, on whom
the actual responsibility of appointing a regent thus devolved.
If in undertaking that responsibility they were guided by any
precedent or analogy at all, it must have been one drawn
from a land far remote from England, but probably better
known to many Englishmen in the days of Richard Cœur-de-Lion’s
nephew than most of the countries nearer home; a
land, too, which for fifty years in the preceding century had
been ruled by kings of the same blood as Richard and Henry
themselves. The “Assizes of Jerusalem” in which the jurisconsults
of Cyprus, towards the end of the thirteenth century,
embodied the traditions of law and custom said to be derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
from a code originally compiled by the first King of the
Latins in Jerusalem, Godfrey of Bouillon, and modified by his
successors down to Saladin’s capture of the Holy City in 1187,
contain an ordinance about minor heirs which runs thus: “If
he” (the minor) “is a lord of land”&mdash;that is, a sovereign or
suzerain lord&mdash;“his body and his fortresses ought to be guarded
as shall be agreed by the community of his men.”<a name="Anchor_327" id="Anchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 327.">[327]</a> This
provision had been acted upon in the case of King Baldwin
III, on whose accession, at the age of thirteen, the princes
and barons of the realm claimed and exercised the right to
elect a regent.<a name="Anchor_328" id="Anchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 328.">[328]</a> What the magnates of Palestine thus did
in 1174 the magnates of England did as freely in 1216. Not
only did Gualo make no claim to the regency for himself, but
he did not even attempt to dictate their choice. If indeed
that choice was influenced by any one outside their own
circle, that one was the late King. John’s commendation,
however, could scarcely have been needed to point out the
man for the office.</p>

<p>Yet that man was one who had not only passed the age of
three score years and ten,<a name="Anchor_329" id="Anchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 329.">[329]</a> but had passed it without ever
having held any office, in court, camp, or administration, of
sufficient importance to give scope for the display of any
special capacities for generalship or government, or for the
acquisition of special knowledge and experience in the conduct
of politics or of war. Neither by birth nor by origin was
William the Marshal a magnate of the highest rank. The
founder of the Marshal family, one Gilbert, who seems to
have been either a cadet or a connexion by marriage of the
Norman house of Tancarville, was marshal to Henry I; that
office became hereditary in his family, and furnished a surname
to all his race. The office of the King’s Marshal was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
twelfth and thirteenth centuries a grand serjeanty and nothing
more; the military duties and responsibilities originally
involved in it had long since passed into other hands, and the
material advantages attached to it seem to have been of
small extent and importance; it gave to its holder little
more than a position of honour and dignity in the royal
household, the right of carrying the sword of state on certain
public occasions, and, possibly, a sort of inchoate right to the
custody of the royal castle of Marlborough. William was a
younger son; at the age of twelve years or thereabouts <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">c. 1155</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> he
was sent, with a companion and a serving-lad, to seek his
fortune abroad, in the household of his father’s cousin William
of Tancarville, the chamberlain of Normandy. There he
shewed so little promise of distinction that the other young
squires declared “William Waste-meat”<a name="Anchor_330" id="Anchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 330.">[330]</a> to be good for
nothing but eating, drinking, and sleeping. The chamberlain,
however, had a better opinion of his young kinsman. He
knighted him at a moment when Henry <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr> and Louis <abbr title="the seventh">VII</abbr>
were at strife and some partisans of Louis were threatening
the Norman Vexin: and Sir William in his first fight&mdash;in defence
of the castle of Drincourt&mdash;proved himself well worthy
of his spurs.<a name="Anchor_331" id="Anchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 331.">[331]</a> But immediately afterwards the two Kings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
made peace; and it was not in war, but in the tournaments
which on the Continent (they were as yet unknown in England)
furnished at once a school of arms and a means of subsistence
for the younger members of the baronial houses in time of
peace, that William first made himself a name.<a name="Anchor_332" id="Anchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 332.">[332]</a></p>

<p>By 1170 William had acquired such a reputation that he was
chosen by Henry <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr> not only to be a member of the household
of the “young King”&mdash;Henry’s eldest son&mdash;but was specially
appointed to watch over and direct the lad’s military training.<a name="Anchor_333" id="Anchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 333.">[333]</a>
Three years later <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1173</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> young Henry himself, when offered knighthood
at the hands of some of the noblest and most illustrious
among the chivalry of France, declared that he would receive
it only from “the best knight that ever was or will be,” and
handed his sword to William the Marshal.<a name="Anchor_334" id="Anchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 334.">[334]</a> After
nearly twelve years of close companionship <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1182</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> slanderous
tongues parted William from the young King, shortly
before the latter’s final revolt against his father.<a name="Anchor_335" id="Anchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 335.">[335]</a> The slander
was, however, detected and William was recalled<a name="Anchor_336" id="Anchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 336.">[336]</a> in time to
watch over his young lord’s death-bed <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1183</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> and receive his dying
charge to fulfil in his stead a vow which he had made of
pilgrimage to the Holy Land.<a name="Anchor_337" id="Anchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 337.">[337]</a> On William’s return to
Europe, early in 1187, Henry <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr> took him into his own service
as a knight of his household;<a name="Anchor_338" id="Anchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 338.">[338]</a> and thenceforth till the hour
of Henry’s death he was the King’s best counsellor and closest
friend.<a name="Anchor_339" id="Anchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 339.">[339]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1189</div>

<p>The first act of Henry’s successor was to confirm a grant
which Henry had promised to William, of the hand of the
greatest heiress in his realm, Isabel de Clare.<a name="Anchor_340" id="Anchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 340.">[340]</a> Her heritage
included the English earldom of Pembroke or Striguil, the
Norman barony of Longueville, and a fief in Ireland comprising
nearly the whole of the ancient kingdom of Leinster.
William’s marriage suddenly raised him from the position of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
a portionless younger son, “without a furrow of land, and
with no fortune but his knighthood,” to that of a magnate of
high rank, great wealth, and considerable territorial importance,
and thus gave him, as a matter of course, a permanent
and definite place in the royal council; but he showed no
disposition to take a prominent part in politics. As one of
the subordinate justiciars appointed by Richard to assist in
the government of the realm during the King’s absence on
Crusade, he at first supported John against William of
Longchamp, and afterwards, when John’s treason was made
manifest, supported the new justiciar, Walter of Coutances,
against John. After Richard’s return William was almost
constantly with him in Normandy, taking his full share in
the warfare with Philip Augustus which occupied the last
five years of Richard’s life; but his share was that of a
devoted follower and a brave knight, not of a great noble
holding an independent command. It was only at Cœur-de-Lion’s
death <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1199</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> that William the Marshal came to the front of
affairs. The dying King had appointed him constable of the
castle of Rouen, which contained the ducal treasure; it was
he who won for Richard’s chosen successor, John, the support
of the Norman primate, and thus largely contributed to
secure for John acceptance in Normandy as duke.<a name="Anchor_341" id="Anchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 341.">[341]</a> The
FitzGilbert patrimony had come to him in 1194, on the death
of his elder brother.<a name="Anchor_342" id="Anchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 342.">[342]</a> The earldom of Pembroke or Striguil,
which he had held by courtesy since his marriage with the
young countess, was granted to him by formal investiture on
John’s coronation day;<a name="Anchor_343" id="Anchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 343.">[343]</a> a few months later the office of
Marshal was conferred by royal charter on him and his heirs
for ever.<a name="Anchor_344" id="Anchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 344.">[344]</a> Throughout the greater part of John’s reign <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1200–1216</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> he
was sheriff of Sussex and Gloucestershire, and he was also an
assistant justice and baron of the Exchequer. For some
years after John’s accession he seems to have been in almost
constant attendance on the King; during the Interdict he
resided chiefly on his Irish lands. From 1213 onwards he
was again John’s constant companion and his most trusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
counsellor; and in that capacity his name stands in the
preamble of the Great Charter first among the lay magnates
in the list of the persons by whose advice the Charter was
granted. Throughout the troubles of the succeeding year
he adhered quietly but steadily to the King, whose dying
testimony has been quoted already&mdash;“He has always served
me loyally; in his loyalty, above that of any other man, I
put my trust.”</p>

<p>Fifteen years earlier, Richard Cœur-de-Lion had repelled
in similar words a charge of treason insinuated against the
Marshal: “God’s Feet! I have always held him for the
most loyal knight in all my realm. I do not believe he has
ever been false.”<a name="Anchor_345" id="Anchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 345.">[345]</a> Three years later, when the death of the
aged regent of England was announced at the court of
France, the flower of the French chivalry vied with each
other in extolling the knightly virtues of their dead enemy,
and Philip Augustus spoke the crowning word of praise:
“You have well said&mdash;but what I say is that he was the most
loyal man I ever knew in any place where I have been.”<a name="Anchor_346" id="Anchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 346.">[346]</a> In
the epithet unanimously chosen by three men so unlike each
other as Richard, John, and Philip, to sum up their opinion
of William the Marshal, lies the key to his whole career, and
to the peculiar place which he held in the estimation of his
contemporaries. What they admired and reverenced in him
was not genius but character; the character, as a modern
French critic has truly said, of the typical knight without
fear and without reproach. One of William’s friends, Aimeric
de <abbr title="Sainte">Ste.</abbr>-Maure, the Master of the Temple, expressed the
general verdict in another way; when he and William
were both on their death-beds, he said: “Bury me beside
William the Marshal, the Good Knight, who has won that
surname by his probity on earth and will carry it with him
to Heaven.”<a name="Anchor_347" id="Anchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 347.">[347]</a> To be thus known as pre-eminently “The
Good Knight” was to have won the highest title of honour
that the medieval world could bestow. The “probity,” or
“prowess,” which constituted the essence of the ideal knightly
character, was a complex quality, hardly to be expressed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
any single word of modern speech; it included valour and
skill in arms; and it also included, above all else, what the
men of the Middle Ages called “loyalty.” Primarily, to
them, loyalty meant the faithful discharge of the obligations
legally involved in the relation between vassal and lord;
obligations, indeed, often disregarded and violated in practice,
but theoretically acknowledged as sacred no less in the days
of John Lackland and Philip Augustus than in the days when
they inspired one of the noblest outbursts of feeling in the
noblest epic of ancient France.<a name="Anchor_348" id="Anchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 348.">[348]</a> This principle of “loyalty” in
the medieval sense was the rule by which the Marshal walked,
with a rare steadfastness and consistency, throughout his life.
The very passages in his career which seem at first glance most
difficult to reconcile with modern ideas on the subject are in
reality illustrations of the simple and literal way in which he
followed his rule, and were thoroughly understood as such by
the sovereigns against whom they brought him temporarily
into opposition.<a name="Anchor_349" id="Anchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 349.">[349]</a> He never concerned himself with abstract
politics; in any given circumstances, his sole concern was to
do his own duty to his own lord, whoever that lord might be.
He knew neither doubt nor fear. He was, indeed, constitutionally
fearless; personal danger of any kind was a thing of
which he seems to have remained through life almost as
unconscious as when in early childhood, a hostage in the
power of Stephen and condemned to be hurled like a stone
from a mangonel into the castle which his father was defending
for the Empress Maud, he had disarmed the King’s wrath
by running up to the deadly engine and begging for a
“swing” in it. But his courage never degenerated into rashness;
he was never eager to fight (except in a tournament)
merely for fighting’s sake, nor willing to countenance violent
measures unless they were imperatively called for by necessity
or honour. His temper was cool and practical. He was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
pioneer of reform or of revolution; he accepted without
question the ordinary standards of public opinion in his day.<a name="Anchor_350" id="Anchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 350.">[350]</a>
His ideal was strictly the ideal of his own time; an ideal,
therefore, which all his contemporaries could understand and
appreciate, and which they could see to be fulfilled in his
person more completely than in that of any other man then
living, at any rate in England. As he was true and just in
the fulfilment of his duty as a vassal, so he was true and just
in all his dealing. When he was but a landless knight,
living by the ransoms of the prisoners and the sale of the
horses captured by him in tournaments, men already knew
that his word was his bond. His lord the “young King,”
Henry <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr>’s son, habitually “spent so much in every place
where he went, that when the hour of departure came, he
knew not how to get away” from his creditors. “Counts,
barons, vavassours” vainly offered to stand surety for the
payment of his debts; the shrewd tradesmen would accept no
such security; but when the Marshal pledged his word that
the accounts should be settled within a month, they exclaimed,
“If the Marshal warrant us, we are as good as paid.”<a name="Anchor_351" id="Anchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 351.">[351]</a> Even
so Louis of France, when from the treasury of England,
exhausted by years of confusion and war, an indemnity was
promised him for his losses and expenses in the invasion,
suffered this important item in the terms of peace to be left
without mention in the written treaty, and trusted for its
fulfilment solely to the regent’s plighted word. Jealousy,
suspicion, party-spirit, could find no occasion against a
character so simple, so unpretending, so honest and straightforward
as that of William the Marshal. Thrice in his long
life&mdash;once by some dastardly comrades who envied the
esteem in which he was held by the two Henrys, twice by
King John&mdash;an attempt was made to cast aspersions on his
honour. Each time he met the calumny in the same way;
he offered to disprove it by ordeal of battle. Each time his
challenge, uttered in the King’s presence and in the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
the court, was answered by a general silence more significant
than words. No man dared encounter William the Marshal in
the ordeal, because every man believed it impossible for the
“judgement of God” to go against the Good Knight who
was without fear because his conscience was without
reproach.</p>

<p>In point of fact, the Legate and the magnates at Gloucester
in October, 1216,<span class="sn_extra"><i>1216</i></span> had set up what we now call a regency; but
the idea which that word conveys to us was to them so
entirely new and strange that they seem to have been at first
unable to find a name for it. Immediately after the coronation
Earl William the Marshal began to exercise the functions of
a regent, and among them that of issuing letters patent and
close in the King’s name. In these letters he, at first, sometimes
styles himself simply “William Marshal Earl of
Pembroke”; but on six occasions he calls himself “Justiciar.”<a name="Anchor_352" id="Anchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 352.">[352]</a>
His assumption of this title is puzzling in more ways than
one. The chief justiciarship of England was not vacant; it
had been given by John in 1215 to Hubert de Burgh, whose
fidelity to John and to his heir is as unquestionable as that of
the Marshal himself, and was being demonstrated by his
defence of Dover against Louis at the very time of the
Marshal’s appointment to the regency. In the thirteenth
century an office granted, as was that of the Justiciar, by
letters patent,<a name="Anchor_353" id="Anchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 353.">[353]</a> to be held during the King’s pleasure, was not
vacated by the King’s death, but belonged of right to the
grantee until he was superseded by means of a new appointment.<a name="Anchor_354" id="Anchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 354.">[354]</a>
Twenty years later Hubert himself declared that he
had been Justiciar “without contradiction” ever since his
appointment by John;<a name="Anchor_355" id="Anchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 355.">[355]</a> it is clear, therefore, that the Marsha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>l’s
assumption of the title was not regarded by Hubert as
implying any design of ousting him from his office. There
was indeed one precedent, dating from the time of Richard,
for the appointment of two chief Justiciars at once. But
Earl William’s position was from the outset not that of a
Justiciar at all. The Justiciar was the King’s second in
command&mdash;the foremost minister of the Crown when the
sovereign was present, his lieutenant and vicegerent when he
was absent from the realm; in either case, his delegate and
nothing more. Earl William was not the King’s delegate; he
had not been appointed by the King and was not removable
at the King’s pleasure; he had been called by the Legate and
the magnates to govern the realm during the King’s minority,
as guardian of the King himself. He was, in modern
phraseology, not Viceroy but Regent. Still, there was just
sufficient analogy between his functions and those which,
under certain circumstances, appertained to the Justiciar,
to suggest his adoption of that title, in a tentative sort of way,
until a better one could be devised.<a name="Anchor_356" id="Anchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 356.">[356]</a> In a word, as his office
was a novelty and an experiment, so its earliest appellation
seems to have been a makeshift. Before the end of November,
1216, that appellation was replaced by a loftier and more
comprehensive one&mdash;“Governor of the king and of the
kingdom.”<a name="Anchor_357" id="Anchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 357.">[357]</a> No attempt seems to have been made at any
further definition either of the limits of his powers, or of his
relation to the royal Council; there was in fact no means of
defining either, nor any authority capable of so doing. In
one sense he was above the council; but in another sense he
was merely its most important member; its other members
acted in subordination to him, but he was not independent of
them; they were the King’s councillors, not his; nay, more&mdash;it
was from them that he had received his authority, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
was thus in some sense responsible to them for his exercise
of it. He was also, and above all, in theory at least,
responsible to the Legate and, through the Legate, to the
Pope.<a name="Anchor_358" id="Anchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 358.">[358]</a> It is thus impossible to determine precisely how
much of the credit of the policy which freed England from
her invaders and restored peace and order to the distracted
country and the ruined administration is due to the Marshal
himself, and how much to his colleagues, Gualo, Hubert,
Peter des Roches, and the other ministers of the late King.
A large share of credit must in any case belong to them for a
steady, faithful, and intelligent co-operation without which
the Marshal obviously could not have carried on either war or
government at all. But it is certain that for two years and a
half after the coronation no act was done in the King’s name
without the Marshal’s consent; for, except on a very few
special occasions, all the royal letters during that period were
attested by him and sealed with his seal.<a name="Anchor_359" id="Anchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 359.">[359]</a> It may therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
fairly be said that whatsoever they did in England, he was
the doer of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1216–1217</div>

<p>One thing there was which, it was clearly understood from
the outset, could not be done at all during the King’s minority.
No grant in perpetuity made by, or in the name of, a person
under age was valid by English law. The application of this
rule to the case of an infant King seems not to have been
expressed till more than two years after Henry’s coronation,
but it was effectually secured during that time by an expedient
whose simplicity and practicality are eminently characteristic
of the Marshal. A grant in perpetuity on the part of the
Crown was invalid unless sealed with the King’s seal. No
great seal was made for Henry till two years after he was
crowned; the seal of the regent served in its stead.<a name="Anchor_360" id="Anchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 360.">[360]</a> On
several occasions during the first year of the regency grants
were made in the King’s name to hold good “till the fourteenth
completed year of our age.”<a name="Anchor_361" id="Anchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 361.">[361]</a> <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1216–1217</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> There was as yet no
fixed rule for the determination of a King’s majority; but the
reigning King of France, Philip Augustus, had been crowned
as his father’s colleague shortly after his fourteenth
birthday, and had exercised the functions of royalty
from that time forth. This was the origin of the rule which
fixed the coming of age of later Kings of France at fourteen
years; and Henry’s guardians seem at first to have contemplated
taking Philip’s case as a precedent for that of their
own boy-sovereign.<a name="Anchor_362" id="Anchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 362.">[362]</a> There was no English precedent to
guide them. Nine years later it was asserted that one
castellan&mdash;Peter de Maulay&mdash;had bound himself by an oath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
to John not to give back the castles of which he had charge
till Henry should be of legal age.<a name="Anchor_363" id="Anchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 363.">[363]</a> It is possible that John
may have demanded and received such an oath from more
than one of the wardens of the royal castles; but evidently
neither they, the Marshal, nor any of the council knew what
was John’s idea&mdash;if he even had one&mdash;of what should
constitute legal age in the case of his successor; the
definition tentatively suggested at the beginning of the reign
was clearly not based upon any direction left by him. At
the close of 1217 it was abandoned, and its place was taken
by a vaguer formula&mdash;“till our coming of age.”<a name="Anchor_364" id="Anchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 364.">[364]</a> The
question of when that was to be could not become urgent
for three years at least; it was therefore wisely put aside for
solution at a more convenient season.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1215–1216</div>

<p>Some indications seem to point to another possible
restriction on the powers of the king’s guardians, in the
shape of a theory that their “pleasure” was not legally
equivalent to “the King’s pleasure”; in other words, that
appointments made by the late King were not revocable
(except for some special reason) during the minority of his
successor. There is however no evidence that this theory was
ever put into explicit words or formally recognized;<a name="Anchor_365" id="Anchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 365.">[365]</a> and
nothing of the kind is needed to account for the fact that the
great majority of the Crown officers appointed by John were
left undisturbed by the Earl Marshal in their several
bailiwicks.<a name="Anchor_366" id="Anchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 366.">[366]</a> Thirteen counties were at John’s death under
sheriffs of foreign birth. Falkes de Bréauté was sheriff of
Northamptonshire, Rutland, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire,
Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire; Peter
de Maulay of Dorset and Somerset; Savaric de Mauléon of
Hampshire; Philip Marc of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire;
Engelard de Cigogné (or d’Athée) of Surrey. The two last
named were members of a family on which “the Barons” of
1215 had conferred a signal mark of distinction, by making it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the subject of a separate article (the fiftieth) in the Great
Charter, whereby John was pledged “to remove altogether
from their bailiwicks the relations of Gerard of Athée,” several
of whom, among them Engelard of Cigogné and Philip Marc,
are mentioned by name, “and all their following, so that they
may never more hold any bailiwick in England.” The
reason for this remarkable enactment was, so far as can be
made out from existing evidence, simply this: that when, after
a struggle in which Gerard of Athée fought gallantly for his
country and his Count,<a name="Anchor_367" id="Anchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 367.">[367]</a> the old Angevin lands were conquered
by Philip Augustus, these kinsmen&mdash;sprung from a group of
little villages between Tours and Loches&mdash;instead of settling
down under the new ruler of Touraine, crossed the sea to seek
employment in the service of their natural-born sovereign and
make homes for themselves in his island realm; that he
entrusted them with offices of considerable importance as well
as (in some cases at least) of considerable pecuniary value,
and especially with the command of some of the chief royal
castles;<a name="Anchor_368" id="Anchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 368.">[368]</a> that they fulfilled the duties thus entrusted to them
with fidelity and efficiency, and that they had under their
control a numerous following of dependents who had
accompanied or rejoined them from beyond the sea, and who
were, like them, faithful soldiers and servants of the King.
We need seek no further for the grounds on which the
“Barons of the Charter” desired to get rid of Gerard
d’Athée and his kindred;<a name="Anchor_369" id="Anchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 369.">[369]</a> nor for the grounds on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the fiftieth article of the Great Charter was omitted in the
revised version issued by Gualo and the Marshal in Henry’s
name. The only puzzle in the matter is why the baronial
party should have singled out the members of this particular
family by name<a name="Anchor_370" id="Anchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 370.">[370]</a> to be made victims of their jealousy and
fear, and not included the other “alien” officers in the
same condemnation (or commendation); for two at least
of those others were men who by origin, class, and character
differed little from Gerard of Athée and his kinsmen.
The third, indeed&mdash;Savaric de Mauléon&mdash;was a noble by
birth, the head of an illustrious family of baronial rank in
Poitou, and a man of personal distinction in other pursuits
besides that of arms; it is needless to say more of him at
present, for, as he returned to his native land shortly after the
council at Bristol, the military and administrative offices held
by him in England were of necessity transferred to other
hands. But Falkes de Bréauté and Peter de Maulay were
simply soldiers of fortune from the continental dominions of
the house of Anjou.<a name="Anchor_371" id="Anchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 371.">[371]</a> Together with the sheriffdom of Dorset,
Peter de Maulay had been entrusted by the late king with
the castle of Corfe, and in it not only the royal treasury
and some important State prisoners, but also the child Richard
who was, after Henry, the next and indeed the only male heir
to the Crown. Since John had deemed Peter a fit person to
have such a charge as this, the darkest hour of the struggle
with the enemies of John’s heir was obviously not the time for
removing him from his post. As to Falkes&mdash;called by
Matthew Paris “the rod of the Lord’s fury”&mdash;he was a man
after John’s own heart, as ruthless and reckless as John
himself; but his fierceness was equalled by his daring valour,
his consummate skill in military affairs, and his zeal in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
royal cause. A glance at the map of England is enough to
shew why John had chosen such a man as this to have charge
of the particular group of counties and castles which he
placed under the command of Falkes; and the story of the
war is enough to justify the wisdom of his choice.<a name="Anchor_372" id="Anchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 372.">[372]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1217</div>

<p>The treaty of Kingston was no sooner concluded than both
parties set to work conscientiously to carry its provisions into
effect. “Reverted perverts” came crowding in to the King’s
allegiance, and as fast as they came their lands were ordered
to be restored to them.<a name="Anchor_373" id="Anchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 373.">[373]</a> On 23rd September Louis and
Henry joined in summoning Alexander of Scotland to make
restitution of the English lands which he had seized during
the war.<a name="Anchor_374" id="Anchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 374.">[374]</a> Orders were promptly issued for the delivery of
prisoners and the payment of ransoms and other moneys due
according to the terms of the treaty.<a name="Anchor_375" id="Anchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 375.">[375]</a> Only two classes of
men suffered any real punishment for their share in the war.
The one class consisted of men of Norman birth who held
or claimed lands in England, and who had taken the side of
Louis; concerning these the sheriffs were warned that “no
seisin is adjudged to them, till the English shall have recovered
their lands in Normandy.”<a name="Anchor_376" id="Anchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 376.">[376]</a> The other class was that of the
clergy who had disobeyed the bishops and the Pope by
supporting Louis; and their punishment came solely from
the Legate. On 27th October he went to London<a name="Anchor_377" id="Anchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 377.">[377]</a> and there
meted out condign punishment to the clergy who had set his
excommunication at naught. He <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>“went to the church of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul, and caused all the altars and all the chalices to be
broken up, and all the vestments to be burnt, and new ones
to be put in their place; and he put in new canons; and the
old ones who had chanted the service in defiance of him he
deprived of all their benefices; and he made the beneficed
clergy of the town exchange their parishes for upland ones.”<a name="Anchor_378" id="Anchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 378.">[378]</a>
“Some of the clergy he degraded; some he sent, still
excommunicate, to the threshold of the Apostles.”<a name="Anchor_379" id="Anchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 379.">[379]</a> Thirteen
clerks “who used threatening language to him and his” he
put in ward at Westminster.<a name="Anchor_380" id="Anchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 380.">[380]</a> What ultimately became of
them we are not told; but on 18th February next year <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1218</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> all
clerks under sentence of excommunication for adherence to
Louis were, in the king’s name, bidden to leave England
before Mid-Lent (22nd March), and warned that if found
there after that date, they would be kept in ward “till the
king should give further orders concerning them.”<a name="Anchor_381" id="Anchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 381.">[381]</a></p>

<p>On Sunday, 29th October, 1217<span class="sn_extra"><i>1217</i></span>&mdash;a year and a day after his
coronation&mdash;the young King entered his capital.<a name="Anchor_382" id="Anchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 382.">[382]</a> “He was
received with glory, and fealty and homage were done to
him,” no doubt by the citizens and by many other “reverted
perverts.” During the ensuing week “many discussions were
held by the King’s guardians and the leading men of the
kingdom concerning the ordering of the realm, the establishment
of peace, and the abolition of evil customs.”<a name="Anchor_383" id="Anchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 383.">[383]</a> The
outcome of these deliberations was a new issue of the
Charter,<a name="Anchor_384" id="Anchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 384.">[384]</a> or what seems to have been meant to be regarded
as the issue of a new Charter; for the preamble (which,
except for the names, is a copy of the preamble of Magna
Charta) ignores all earlier documents. As a matter of fact,
however, this Charter is a revised edition of the Charter of
1216, from which it differs only in the following particulars:
In the article concerning widows, the amount of legal dowry
is, for the first time, defined: it is fixed at a third part of all
the husband’s lands, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>“unless she have been dowered with a
less amount at the church door.”<a name="Anchor_385" id="Anchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 385.">[385]</a> The article relating to the
judicial eyres and the three recognitions is modified.
Recognitions of mort d’ancester and novel disseisin are to be
taken in the several shires before justices who are to be sent
thither once (instead of four times) a year, and who are to
hold the assizes “with the knights of the shires”<a name="Anchor_386" id="Anchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 386.">[386]</a>&mdash;not, it
seems, as in 1215 and 1216, with four knights specially elected
for the purpose; if these assizes cannot be completed on
the day fixed, the cases are to be dealt with, not as in 1215
and 1216 by a sufficient number of knights and freeholders
who are to remain on the spot for that intent, but by the
judges “elsewhere on their eyre,” or if the cases are too
difficult they are to be referred to and settled by the judges
of the Bench;<a name="Anchor_387" id="Anchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 387.">[387]</a> and the assizes of darrein presentment are to
be always held and settled by these last-named judges.<a name="Anchor_388" id="Anchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 388.">[388]</a> In
the article regulating the imposition of amercements the
king’s villeins are excepted from the safeguard given to the
villeins of other lords.<a name="Anchor_389" id="Anchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 389.">[389]</a> The article concerning the requisition
of corn or cattle is modified by the extension of the limit of
time for payment from twenty-one days to forty.<a name="Anchor_390" id="Anchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 390.">[390]</a> On the
other hand, carts belonging to an ecclesiastical person, a
knight, or a lady, are henceforth not to be requisitioned
at all.<a name="Anchor_391" id="Anchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 391.">[391]</a> The unsupported accusation of a Crown bailiff is
henceforth to be insufficient not only for sending a man to
the ordeal, but also for compelling him to make compurgation.<a name="Anchor_392" id="Anchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 392.">[392]</a>
The King’s promise to take no unfair advantage of his
possession of escheats is made still more definite.<a name="Anchor_393" id="Anchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 393.">[393]</a> Of the six
matters spoken of in John’s Charter which were expressly
mentioned in clause 42 of the Charter of 1216 as being
postponed for future consideration&mdash;the assessment of scutages
and aids, the rights of Jewish and other creditors against the
heirs of deceased debtors, liberty of ingress into and egress
from the realm, the regulation of forests and warrens, the
customs of the shires, and the river-enclosures and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
keepers&mdash;the fourth was left to be dealt with in a separate
Charter of the Forest; to three others as many new articles
were devoted. No river-enclosures are henceforth to be kept
up save those which were in existence in the time of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr><a name="Anchor_394" id="Anchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 394.">[394]</a>
Respecting the “customs of the shires,” the provision in the
twenty-fifth chapter of Magna Charta (to which the words on
that subject in the closing paragraph of Henry’s first Charter
must refer), that all shires and other local jurisdictions except
those on the royal domains shall be at their “old ferm”
without increment, is not renewed; but in its stead there is a
clause regulating the holding of the county courts and the
sheriff’s tourn. The shire court is to be held not oftener than
once a month, and at longer intervals where such have been
customary. No sheriff or his bailiff is to make his tourn in
the hundred except twice a year&mdash;after Easter and after
Michaelmas&mdash;and only in the proper and accustomed place.
View of frankpledge is to be made at Michaelmas term, in
such a manner “that every man shall have the liberties which
he used to have in the time of our grandfather King Henry,
or which he has since acquired, and so that our peace shall be
kept, and the tithing shall be complete as it was wont to be;
and the sheriff is to seek no occasions, and is to be content
with what the sheriff used to have for holding his view in
King Henry’s time.”<a name="Anchor_395" id="Anchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 395.">[395]</a> Concerning the once crucial question
which had furnished the original pretext for the rising of the
barons against John, the guardians could now venture to
reassert the rights of the Crown; and they did so, but in terms
carefully chosen so as to avoid all reference to the late
troubles: “Scutage shall be taken henceforth as it used to be
taken in the time of our grandfather King Henry.”<a name="Anchor_396" id="Anchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 396.">[396]</a> Two
other new articles were added, whose connexion with the
scutage clause is not difficult to see. The one enacted that
henceforth no free man should either give away or sell so
much of his land as that the residue should be insufficient to
furnish the service due to the lord of the fief;<a name="Anchor_397" id="Anchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 397.">[397]</a> the other
forbade that any man should give his land to a religious house
for the purpose of receiving it back again to hold of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
house, and enacted that if any man were convicted of so
doing, his donation should be void, and his land forfeited to
the lord.<a name="Anchor_398" id="Anchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 398.">[398]</a> The other omissions were disposed of, for the
moment, by a general saving clause: “Reserving to the
archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, Templars, Hospitallers,
earls, barons, and all other persons both ecclesiastical and
secular, the liberties and free customs which they had before.”<a name="Anchor_399" id="Anchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 399.">[399]</a>
Lastly, it was ordained also “by common consent of the whole
realm” that all adulterine castles, that is, castles which had been
built or rebuilt since the beginning of the war between the
late King and his barons, should be immediately destroyed.<a name="Anchor_400" id="Anchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 400.">[400]</a>
This Charter has no date. It was, doubtless issued in the
early days of November; probably on the 6th, for on that
day there was issued a Charter of the Forest which dealt
amply with the grievances connected with the abuse of Forest
law.<a name="Anchor_401" id="Anchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 401.">[401]</a></p>

<p>The article concerning scutage was inserted in the Charter
for an immediate and important purpose; it was the ratification
of a tax which the Council had imposed a few days
before the Charters were issued. Of the many problems
with which the Marshal and his colleagues had to grapple
one of the most urgent and most difficult was that of finance.
The confused entries on the Pipe Rolls of John’s later years
indicate that the financial administration of the realm had been
gradually drifting towards chaos from 1212 onwards; in 1215
chaos was reached, and the machinery of the Exchequer came
to a standstill. After Michaelmas, 1214, no session of the
Exchequer was held, no accounts were rendered by any of
the sheriffs or other bailiffs of the Crown, for more than three
years. John had met the expenses of the war partly by payments
out of the treasury, partly by means of writs addressed
to various fiscal officers throughout the country, directing
them to make on his behalf certain payments out of the ferms
for which they were accountable at the Exchequer.<a name="Anchor_402" id="Anchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 402.">[402]</a> As,
however, “no one”&mdash;as a chronicler says&mdash;“would pay any
money to the King” or his representatives, and as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span> considerable
part of the kingdom was in the possession of the enemy,
both of these resources must have been well-nigh exhausted
before the death of John, who was in fact reduced at last
to sheer plunder to provide for the maintenance of his troops.
The Marshal at the outset of his regency seems to have
sought help towards providing the sinews of war in the levy
of a hidage, carucage, and “aid,” this last word probably
representing a tallage from the towns. Of the time and
circumstances of their imposition there is no record, but it is
most probable that the matter was decided in the council at
Bristol immediately after the coronation, in November, 1216.<a name="Anchor_403" id="Anchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 403.">[403]</a>
Of course none of these taxes could be collected in the districts
which were under the control of Louis or his partisans.
In July, 1217, the Pope ordered the prelates to contribute an
aid to the King’s necessities.<a name="Anchor_404" id="Anchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 404.">[404]</a> Meanwhile wages, allowances,
and other payments were made by means of jewels from the
royal treasury, and in cloth of silk, samite, and baldaquin
from the royal wardrobe.<a name="Anchor_405" id="Anchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 405.">[405]</a></p>

<p>At the earliest possible moment an effort was made to revive
the working of the Exchequer. Its records were for some time
previous to the end of the war in the possession of Louis, and
were restored only on the conclusion of peace in the middle
of September;<a name="Anchor_406" id="Anchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 406.">[406]</a> the session seems therefore to have been appointed
for Martinmas,<a name="Anchor_407" id="Anchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 407.">[407]</a> instead of Michaelmas which was
the customary date. Before Martinmas came, however, it was
found, apparently, that some of the sheriffs could not get their
accounts ready by the appointed day; and ultimately they
seem to have been allowed to bring them up at various times
from November, 1217, till a fortnight after Easter, 1218.<a name="Anchor_408" id="Anchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 408.">[408]</a> The
accounts thus rendered were those for the first half of the
seventeenth (fiscal) year of King John, from Michaelmas, 1214,
to Easter, 1215; in other words, the last fiscal half-year completed
before the outbreak of war between the barons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the King.<a name="Anchor_409" id="Anchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 409.">[409]</a> For the second half of that year, and for the
whole of the two succeeding years up to Michaelmas, 1217,
no accounts were ever rendered or demanded; the first Pipe
Roll of Henry <abbr title="the Third">III</abbr> is the roll of his second year, from Michaelmas,
1217, to Michaelmas, 1218, and it contains no mention of
arrears.<a name="Anchor_410" id="Anchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 410.">[410]</a> This arrangement was both practical and equitable.
The accounts for 1215–1217 must in many cases, through no
fault of the persons responsible for them, have been in a confusion
impossible to disentangle; some of the shires had been
entirely in the possession of the King’s enemies; to many of
the sheriffs and other Crown bailiffs the King must have been
really more in debt than they were to him. With a budget
thus restricted and a treasury thus exhausted the Marshal had
to carry on the King’s government and pay the indemnity
which he had promised to Louis.</p>

<p>“Our faithful Earl William the Marshal has bound himself
to the Lord Louis on our behalf, under no small penalty, to
the payment of ten thousand marks, for the boon of peace
between Louis and ourself”&mdash;such is the official statement
made, a year later, in a letter written in Henry’s name to the
Pope.<a name="Anchor_411" id="Anchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 411.">[411]</a> This amount was independent of the sums due to
Louis, according to the terms of the treaty, from towns and
individuals who had made agreement with him on condition
of a financial aid or tribute which they had not yet paid; the
aggregate of these latter sums appears to have been reckoned
at something between five and seven thousand marks.<a name="Anchor_412" id="Anchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 412.">[412]</a> On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
23rd September letters patent were issued ordering that these
debts should be paid without delay to Louis’s Marshal,
William de Beaumont.<a name="Anchor_413" id="Anchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 413.">[413]</a> For the receipt of the indemnity
Louis appointed as his attorneys two merchants of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Omer,
Florence (or Florentinus) “the Rich” and his son William.
This appointment seems to have been made for the joint
convenience of Louis and Henry. Louis apparently wanted
six thousand marks sterling paid down, and received them
from Florence and William, who themselves supplied the
amount on a promise made to them on 23rd September in
Henry’s name that half the sum thus advanced should be
repaid to them on All Saints’ day and the rest at Candlemas;
a part of the first instalment of repayment was to be made in
fells and wool; if these were not duly delivered Henry was
to pay Florence and William an additional sum of five
hundred marks sterling “for the profit of that merchandise.”
If the whole debt to the two merchants were not paid at the
term appointed, Count Peter of Brittany and Robert of Arène
were authorized by the King, the Earl Marshal, and the royal
Council to seize and hold on behalf of Louis “any goods
belonging to the King and his realm that they could get, to
the value of the amount due,” until it was paid.<a name="Anchor_414" id="Anchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 414.">[414]</a> A letter
from the Marshal in his own name to the King of France at
once illustrates the scrupulous honesty for which he had long
been renowned, and shews that he doubted the possibility of
fulfilling these promises to Florence. “If,” he writes, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>“our
agreement with Florence be not kept, we desire and grant
that you assign all the land which we hold of you to Florence
and his son till the whole debt and interest due to them shall
be discharged, saving only our service to you for the said
lands.”<a name="Anchor_415" id="Anchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 415.">[415]</a> His doubts were justified; eleven months later the
debt to Florence and William still amounted to no less than
two thousand one hundred and fifty marks.<a name="Anchor_416" id="Anchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 416.">[416]</a> To bring it
down to this he had had to borrow more than five hundred
marks in the King’s name from various merchants of Ireland,
Wales, and England, and several hundred more from other
individuals, and to lend nine hundred marks out of his own
purse;<a name="Anchor_417" id="Anchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 417.">[417]</a> and the financial straits of the Crown are further
illustrated by the fact that the total of wool required for the
first instalment of repayment to Florence had had to be made
up by seizing several sacks belonging to individual merchants
at Northampton fair, one of whom did not receive compensation
till the end of November, 1218, while another had to
wait for it till the middle of February, 1219.<a name="Anchor_418" id="Anchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 418.">[418]</a> It seems to
have been originally proposed that the whole indemnity
should be paid by <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Andrew’s day, 1217;<a name="Anchor_419" id="Anchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 419.">[419]</a> but this was
manifestly impracticable. The account with Louis was in
fact not closed till 1219 at the earliest, for the last five
hundred marks needed to wipe out the debt were lent to
Henry by Gualo’s successor in the legation, Pandulf.<a name="Anchor_420" id="Anchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 420.">[420]</a></p>

<p>The very first thing, therefore, to be laid before and
sanctioned by the Great Council of the realm when at the
end of October, 1217, it was once more gathered round the
sovereign in his capital city, was a scheme of taxation for
the year. This consisted of a scutage of the ordinary
amount&mdash;two shillings on the knight’s fee&mdash;a tallage, a hidage,
and a carucage. These taxes were imposed, as had been the
practice in the time of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr>, in the full council of the
barons.<a name="Anchor_421" id="Anchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 421.">[421]</a> The formal imposition of the scutage must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
taken place on the very day of Henry’s entry into London,
29th October, or at latest on the following morning. This
tax was avowedly destined for the payment of the indemnity.<a name="Anchor_422" id="Anchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 422.">[422]</a>
It was obviously for purposes connected with finance that
an inquisition concerning the King’s demesne lands had been
ordered in September;<a name="Anchor_423" id="Anchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 423.">[423]</a> and on 9th November, commissioners
were despatched to assess the tallage on these demesnes, and
to make searching inquiries about escheats and about all lands
“into which there is no entry except through the sheriffs or
bailiffs and without due warrant,”<a name="Anchor_424" id="Anchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 424.">[424]</a> and to seize all such into
the King’s hand.<a name="Anchor_425" id="Anchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 425.">[425]</a> At the same time the King’s justiciars in
Ireland were directed to lay a “tallage and efficacious aid”
upon the cities, towns, and royal demesnes in that country,
and to “beg of the Kings of Connaught and Thomond and
the other kings in Ireland, and of the barons and knights who
held in chief of the King, such an efficient aid that the King
should evermore be thankful to them”; and they were further
exhorted to send the money thus collected to England with
all possible speed.<a name="Anchor_426" id="Anchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 426.">[426]</a></p>

<p>The first judicial eyre of the new reign seems to have been
held very soon after the second issue of the Charter, and to
have had for one of its objects the administering of the oath
of fealty to the King’s subjects in general. To one district,
at least, there went six justices itinerant before whom the
knights and other free men swore that they would keep the
peace of the Church, the King, and the realm, and would
help and defend all persons who were willing to keep it
likewise; that they would obey all “reasonable” commands
of the King, and uphold the royal rights, and hold the good
laws and customs of the realm; that if any man should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
presume to contravene the same, they would at the bidding of
the King and his council come together faithfully in force
and amend the matter to the utmost of their power; that
“neither for hatred, nor favour, nor fear” would they fail to
keep their fealty; that they would do and receive justice
according to the reasonable customs and laws of England;
that no previous or subsequent oath should hinder their
observance of all these things; and that “in all these things
they would support the Marshal.”<a name="Anchor_427" id="Anchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 427.">[427]</a></p>

<p>The various dependencies of the English Crown had next
to be secured. Alexander of Scotland had taken advantage
of the troubles in England to seize the town and castle of
Carlisle. As early as 23rd September, 1217, the Marshal
peremptorily demanded restitution of these and of the other
lands and the prisoners taken by Alexander during the war;
and at the same time he bade the prelates and magnates of
the North, if Alexander did not immediately comply with the
demand, give the sheriff of Cumberland their “efficient aid
and counsel” in forcing him to do so.<a name="Anchor_428" id="Anchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 428.">[428]</a> Alexander seems to
have yielded at once. The Marshal had a hold over him; the
English honour of Huntingdon, which the Scot Kings had
held since 1136 and which they dearly prized, was in the
hand of King Henry. On 6th November an escort was
ordered to meet Alexander at Berwick on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Andrew’s day
and bring him “to speak with us and do to us what he ought
to do.”<a name="Anchor_429" id="Anchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 429.">[429]</a> The meeting seems to have taken place on 17th or
18th December at Northampton;<a name="Anchor_430" id="Anchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 430.">[430]</a> on the 19th Alexander,
having done his homage, received seisin of his English lands,<a name="Anchor_431" id="Anchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 431.">[431]</a>
and a safe-conduct till Candlemas Day for his journey home.<a name="Anchor_432" id="Anchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 432.">[432]</a></p>

<p>Far more troublesome and dangerous vassals than the
Scot king were the native princes of Wales. In ancient
times Wales had been divided into three kingdoms: Gwynedd,
answering roughly to the modern counties of Flint, part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
of Denbigh, Carnarvon, Anglesey, and the western part of
Merioneth; Powys, stretching from the mouth of the Dee
to the river Wye, and including, besides the southern part of
what is now Denbighshire and the eastern part of Merioneth,
the present shires of Montgomery and Radnor; and Deheubarth,
which included, besides the remaining shires of the
modern South Wales, the district of Monmouth as far east as
the Wye. These three kingdoms had been separate and
independent, although a sort of overlordship or primacy
seems to have been recognized as appertaining to the Kings of
Gwynedd. By the end of the twelfth century Gwynedd
was the only one of these three States which remained
purely Welsh in population and government. The whole
of Deheubarth and the greater part of Powys were dotted
over with Norman castles, every one of which was the
capital of a lordship held by a baron of Norman or English
race, owning allegiance to no one save the English King.<a name="Anchor_433" id="Anchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 433.">[433]</a>
Neither these “marcher lords” nor their sovereign, however,
had made any real progress towards conquering the country
or its people; they were, so to say, detachments of a feudal
host encamped here and there in a foreign land, and surrounded
by a native population which still maintained its own customs
and laws and recognized no authority except that of its own
hereditary chieftains. Between the two peoples there was
a bitter racial and national feud; but the relations between
the Norman lords marchers and the Welsh princes varied
greatly. It was not for the interest of the former to quarrel
unnecessarily with their Welsh neighbours at any time; and
when they themselves chanced to be in rebellion against their
own sovereign&mdash;as was the case with some of them, notably
with the great house of Breuse in south-eastern Wales, in the
latter years of John’s reign&mdash;they naturally found it convenient
to make alliance with the native rulers of the land. These,
on the other hand, were often at feud among themselves, and
did not scruple to make use of the marchers’ aid against one
another when it suited them, though at other times they were
ready to make common cause against the common enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1216</div>

<p>At the opening of Henry’s reign the native element in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Wales was very distinctly in the ascendent. The old
superiority, or primacy, of Gwynedd had once more become
a living thing. Llywelyn ap Iorwerth had been for more
than twenty years <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1194–1216</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> extending his power over the southern
and eastern principalities. He had in 1206 accepted the
hand of John’s elder daughter Joan&mdash;the child, seemingly,
of John’s early dissolved marriage with Isabel of Gloucester<a name="Anchor_434" id="Anchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 434.">[434]</a>&mdash;but
throughout the civil war his sympathies were openly and
actively with John’s enemies. In 1215 he “and the Welsh
princes in general” attacked Caermarthen and destroyed the
castle, and also took and destroyed most of the other castles
in South Wales.<a name="Anchor_435" id="Anchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 435.">[435]</a> On the other hand, his chief rival, Gwenwynwyn,
the prince of southern Powys, offered his service to
John; whereupon Llywelyn, with “most of the princes,”
marched into Powys and “took possession of Gwenwynwyn’s
whole territory to himself” in 1216.<a name="Anchor_436" id="Anchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 436.">[436]</a> At the close of 1215
the Bishop of Hereford had died.<a name="Anchor_437" id="Anchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 437.">[437]</a> He was Giles de Breuse,
the head of a family whose patrimony&mdash;comprising Radnor,
Brecon, and Abergavenny in Wales, besides Totnes and
Barnstaple in Devonshire and Bramber in Sussex&mdash;had been
forfeited to the Crown in 1210 under circumstances which
made it well-nigh impossible that confidence should ever be
restored between the house of Breuse and King John. Giles
had indeed, only a few weeks before his death, fined with the
King for restitution of all the lands which had been his
father’s;<a name="Anchor_438" id="Anchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 438.">[438]</a> but his next brother, Reginald, on succeeding to
his hereditary claims, set himself to prosecute them by
making common cause with the King’s enemies in Wales.
Llywelyn was now at the height of his triumph, not only in
Powys, but also in Deheubarth; in 1216, at Aberdovey, in
his presence and obviously under his dictation, South Wales
was portioned out between the four rival representatives of
its sovereign house, Maelgwn and Rhys “the Hoarse” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
their nephews “Young Rhys” and Owen.<a name="Anchor_439" id="Anchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 439.">[439]</a> These latter were
cousins to Reginald de Breuse.<a name="Anchor_440" id="Anchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 440.">[440]</a> With Llywelyn Reginald
formed a closer connexion by taking one of his daughters to
wife.<a name="Anchor_441" id="Anchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 441.">[441]</a> In August, 1216, John visited the Welsh border and
sought to win the support of some of the princes, and also
of Reginald de Breuse, but it “did not avail him anything.”<a name="Anchor_442" id="Anchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 442.">[442]</a>
Evidently they all saw in John’s extremity, and after his
death in his successor’s youth and helplessness, their long-desired
opportunity for revenge; and we can hardly doubt
that it was a combination of Welshmen and followers of
Reginald de Breuse who attacked Goodrich on the eve of
Henry’s coronation. Gualo’s interdict published a fortnight
later shows how clearly it was understood that Wales as a
whole “held with the barons.”</p>

<p>Early in 1217<span class="sn_extra"><i>1217</i></span> the Earl Marshal wrote in the young King’s
name to Reginald de Breuse, urging him to return to his
allegiance and promising that if he did so, the whole of his
patrimony should be restored to him.<a name="Anchor_443" id="Anchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 443.">[443]</a> Reginald however
continued obstinate till the Royalist victory at Lincoln.
Then he, like many others, seems to have realized that the
tide had turned, and that it was time for him to turn likewise.
Before Midsummer he had submitted, and he was
soon reinstated in the Irish and English possessions of his
father.<a name="Anchor_444" id="Anchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 444.">[444]</a> His Welsh kinsfolk promptly punished his desertion
of their party; Rhys and Owen wrested from him “the whole
of Builth except the castles”; Llywelyn marched upon
Brecknock. Reginald however succeeded in patching up
some kind of peace with his father-in-law, who thereupon
turned his arms against the Flemings of Pembrokeshire, and
compelled<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>Sept.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> them all to promise him tribute and submission.<a name="Anchor_445" id="Anchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 445.">[445]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1217</div>

<p>To Llywelyn, as to King Alexander, the treaty of Kingston
was duly notified by Louis.<a name="Anchor_446" id="Anchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 446.">[446]</a> The new Bishop of Hereford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
and the Bishop of Coventry were, it seems, empowered by
the Legate to receive the submission of all the Welsh princes
and absolve them from excommunication at Hereford on
18th November; when this was done, Hugh de Mortimer<a name="Anchor_447" id="Anchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 447.">[447]</a> and
some other barons were to escort them to Northampton for a
meeting with the King.<a name="Anchor_448" id="Anchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 448.">[448]</a> Henry and the Marshal were at
Northampton on 17th and 18th December;<a name="Anchor_449" id="Anchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 449.">[449]</a> but evidently the
Welsh princes did not come. It may have been to keep
guard on the Welsh border that the Marshal took his young
sovereign to keep Christmas at Gloucester,<a name="Anchor_450" id="Anchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 450.">[450]</a> and lingered with
him in the west of England throughout the first four months
of the new year<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>1218<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>. In February, 1218, a safe-conduct was issued
to Llywelyn that he might come and do homage to the King
at Worcester.<a name="Anchor_451" id="Anchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 451.">[451]</a> No date is fixed in the letter, and no record
of the homage appears to exist; but there can be no doubt
that it was performed at the appointed place on or before 17th
March, for on that day, at Worcester, the castles of Cardigan
and Caermarthen with the lands appertaining to them were
committed by the King and his council to his “beloved
brother-in-law Llywelyn, Prince of North Wales,” that he
might hold them till the King’s coming of age, maintaining
them out of their own revenues, and administering justice
within their territories in the King’s name.<a name="Anchor_452" id="Anchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 452.">[452]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1218</div>

<p>Two days before, a safe-conduct had been issued to all the
magnates of both North and South Wales to come and do
homage at Worcester at the close of Easter (22nd April).<a name="Anchor_453" id="Anchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 453.">[453]</a> It
does not appear whether any of them came, except Llywelyn,
who seems to have come for a special purpose. Morgan, the
lord of Caerleon-upon-Usk, had taken no notice of repeated
admonitions from Louis to observe the treaty of Kingston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
and had deliberately broken truce by slaying in one day no
less than ten Anglo-Normans of gentle birth, and also
burning twenty-two churches.<a name="Anchor_454" id="Anchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 454.">[454]</a> The Marshal had put an
effectual stop to such proceedings on Morgan’s part; he
“fought against Caerleon and took it”<a name="Anchor_455" id="Anchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 455.">[455]</a>&mdash;that is, according to
his own biographer, his bailiff “called up his men and his
friends and besieged Caerleon, and it was taken.” At the
“parliament” at Worcester Llywelyn asked that Morgan
should, like the other allies of Louis, be formally reinstated
in the right to hold his land “according to the terms of the
treaty,” that is, as he had held it before the war. The
regent, acting on the advice of “his council”&mdash;defined as
“all those who were in fealty to him”<a name="Anchor_456" id="Anchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 456.">[456]</a>&mdash;refused, on the
ground of Morgan’s flagrant infraction of the peace; and the
“parliament” adjudged Caerleon and its appurtenances to its
conqueror.<a name="Anchor_457" id="Anchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 457.">[457]</a> The general homage of Welsh magnates seems
to have been postponed from the close of Easter to the
morrow of Ascension day, 25th May.<a name="Anchor_458" id="Anchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 458.">[458]</a> On that or the following
day, at Woodstock,<a name="Anchor_459" id="Anchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 459.">[459]</a> it at last took place, so far at least as
concerned Deheubarth; the Welsh chronicles themselves tell
us that “young Rhys went himself, and all the princes, by the
advice of Llywelyn, to the court of the king, from South
Wales, to do him homage.”<a name="Anchor_460" id="Anchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 460.">[460]</a></p>

<p>The homage of King Ragnald “of the Isles”&mdash;that is, the
Isle of Man and the Orkneys&mdash;took longer to win, probably
because he was geographically more difficult to reach. On
16th January, 1218, he was summoned to come over and do
homage “and make amends for the excesses committed by
his men against King Henry’s men, both in England and in
Ireland,” and a safe-conduct was given him, to last till
30th April,<a name="Anchor_461" id="Anchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 461.">[461]</a> but he did not come; on 1st May another safe-conduct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>was issued to him, till 1st August,<a name="Anchor_462" id="Anchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 462.">[462]</a> again with no
result; and it was not till September, 1219, that he actually
came.<a name="Anchor_463" id="Anchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 463.">[463]</a> Neither his personal contumacy nor the piratical
“excesses” of his seafaring subjects, however, constituted
a real danger to the peace of the realm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1217</div>

<p>In the Irish dominions of the English Crown the first
trouble that arose under the new reign came neither from the
barons nor from the people, but from the Justiciar. Geoffrey
de Marsh, who had held that office in Ireland since 1215, no
sooner heard of the death of King John <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1216</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> than he despatched
to Henry, or to his guardians, letters in which he assured his
young sovereign of his fidelity, and asked for instructions how
to act for the furtherance of his interests in Ireland. He
seems to have suggested that the Queen-mother, or the heir-presumptive,
little Richard, should be sent thither to represent
the Crown.<a name="Anchor_464" id="Anchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 464.">[464]</a> The Marshal sent him in reply a letter in the
King’s name, informing him of the coronation and the
proceedings of the council of Bristol, and requesting him to
receive for Henry the homage of the magnates and the King’s
other subjects in Ireland; also promising to send them in
return a confirmation of the same liberties which had just
been granted to their fellow-subjects in England. The
suggestion about the Queen and Richard was politely waived
with an assurance that it should be duly considered. Geoffrey
was warmly thanked for his past and present loyalty, and entreated
to redouble his efforts in behalf of a King whose tender
years made him the more in need of his liegemen’s counsel
and aid.<a name="Anchor_465" id="Anchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 465.">[465]</a> On 6th February, 1217,<span class="sn_extra"><i>1217</i></span> a copy of the Charter was
sent to Ireland with a letter in the King’s name addressed to
all the King’s faithful subjects in Ireland, expressing his
desire that as a reward for their fidelity to his father and
a motive for its continuance towards himself they and their
heirs for ever should, of his grace and gift, enjoy the same
liberties which his father and he had granted to the realm of
England.<a name="Anchor_466" id="Anchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 466.">[466]</a> The Marshal’s policy was to bind the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
March in Ireland as closely as possible to the Crown; he had
already issued letters patent forbidding the election of Irishmen
to cathedral dignities within the King’s land in Ireland,
“because by such elections the peace of that land has
frequently been disturbed,” and commanding that when such
dignities fell vacant, clerks of the King and other “honest
Englishmen useful to us” (the King) “and our realm” should
be elected and promoted thereto by the joint counsel of the
Archbishop of Dublin and the Justiciar.<a name="Anchor_467" id="Anchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 467.">[467]</a> The Archbishop of
Dublin, Henry of London, was at that time in England; but
on 16th April, “although,” writes the King to the barons in
Ireland, “we feel his presence here is most necessary to us
and our realm, and we can hardly do without his counsel,” he
was sent to “visit and console” his diocese, and also expressly
to assist the Justiciar with his counsel and support in ordering
and amending the condition of the King’s Irish territory;
while the Justiciar was bidden to “acquiesce in all things” in
the counsel of the Archbishop, and to be guided by it in his
expenditure of the money received at the Dublin Exchequer,
“forasmuch as the King wills that nothing be done without his
assent.”<a name="Anchor_468" id="Anchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 468.">[468]</a></p>

<p>The position of the Justiciar of the Irish March at this
time was very much more independent than that of the Chief
Justiciar of England. The Justiciar in Ireland seems to have
practically had the entire control of the whole machinery of
government, administration, and finance, throughout the
King’s Irish domains. The revenues due to the Crown,
whether derived from demesne lands, or from taxes, or tolls,
or from the proceeds of escheats, fines, wardships, reliefs, and
the like, seem to have all passed through his hands. The
fixed revenue of the Crown lands was assigned to him for the
necessary expenses of government and for maintaining the
defence of the land and the garrisons of the royal castles, and
in remuneration of his own services; the residue he was
supposed to pay into the Exchequer in Dublin, for transmission
to the King when required. Moreover, it seems to
have been he who appointed the wardens of the King’s castles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
throughout the March.<a name="Anchor_469" id="Anchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 469.">[469]</a> Such a system offered facilities for
almost unlimited embezzlement on the part of a dishonest
Justiciar, or mismanagement and waste on the part of an
incompetent one; while it left to the English government
scarcely any means of proving a charge of either dishonesty
or incompetence against an officer at once so remote and
invested with so much independent authority. It seems clear
that the reports, and the results, of Geoffrey’s financial
administration which reached England were not satisfactory
to the regent, and that the Archbishop of Dublin was really
sent not so much to “assist” the Justiciar as to hold him in
check and keep a watch on his proceedings. Eight months
later Geoffrey had to be reprimanded<a name="Anchor_470" id="Anchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 470.">[470]</a> for not having yet
executed a royal order issued on Midsummer day for the
restoration of Limerick to Reginald de Breuse<a name="Anchor_471" id="Anchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 471.">[471]</a>; and on 12th
February, 1218,<span class="sn_extra"><i>1218</i></span> a long letter of remonstrance was written to
him in the King’s name. He had been bidden to come over
and do his homage, and certify the King as to the state of the
Crown’s Irish lands; the King is “greatly surprised” that he
has not yet come, and again bids him come without fail
before Easter next, and bring with him all the money that the
King’s subjects and bailiffs in Ireland can be induced to
furnish, for the payment of the debt to Louis, and of six
hundred marks owed to the Pope, being two years’ arrears of
the tribute due to him from Ireland.<a name="Anchor_472" id="Anchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 472.">[472]</a> Whether Geoffrey sent
any money does not appear; he certainly did not come over
in person; probably, however, he made some excuse which
gave the Marshal no grounds for questioning his loyalty, for
his homage was left in abeyance till after the Marshal’s
death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1218</div>

<p>In England itself every effort was made by the government
to carry out loyally the terms of the treaty of Kingston
and the provisions of the Charter. On 22nd February the
two Charters&mdash;the Charter of Liberties and that of the
Forest&mdash;were sent certainly to one, probably to all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
the sheriffs, with instructions to publish them in the shire-courts,
and to make all the men of the shire swear to the
observance of them, as well as to take an oath of fealty to the
King; especial stress was laid on the execution of the last
clause in the Charter of Liberties, which enjoined the
destruction of adulterine castles.<a name="Anchor_473" id="Anchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 473.">[473]</a> In July the chief
Justiciar of the Forest, John Marshal, the regent’s nephew,
was despatched on a Forest circuit to make arrangements for
deafforestations to be carried out according to the Forest
Charter.<a name="Anchor_474" id="Anchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 474.">[474]</a> Such of the prisoners taken during the war, and of
their captors, as were dissatisfied with regard to questions of
ransom were by public proclamation, made through the
sheriffs each in his shire, invited or summoned to shew
their complaints on 6th May before the King’s council at
Westminster, for the settlement of their respective claims
and the composing of their mutual differences.<a name="Anchor_475" id="Anchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 475.">[475]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1217</div>

<p>As a chronicler says, “it was difficult speedily to satisfy the
desires of all men, and to allay in a moment the rancour of
so many dissidents”; and it was also, after the turmoil of the
last few years, difficult for men of the fighting classes to settle
down to a life of peace. Some of them “found an outlet for the
relics of discord” in tournaments.<a name="Anchor_476" id="Anchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 476.">[476]</a> The real war was no sooner
ended <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1217</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> than Englishmen became possessed by a rage for these
military exercises, which until the time of King Richard had
never been permitted in England, and were everywhere and
always discountenanced by the Church. Their revival at a
moment when the embers of war were still smouldering was
obviously a matter of grave peril, requiring to be dealt with
promptly and firmly. It was a curious turn of fate that compelled
the Earl Marshal, who had spent his youth and acquired
his knightly repute in the lists of France and Flanders,
to use his power for the suppression of this mimic warfare in
his native land; and the first letter patent in which a
tournament was forbidden by him&mdash;on 4th October, 1217,
little more than a week after the departure of Louis&mdash;reveals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
with characteristic simplicity his reluctance to commit his
young sovereign to a condemnation of tournaments in
general; “Know ye,” the King is made to say, “that we will
and ordain that this tournament be not held, for no other
reason than this, that we fear a disturbance of our realm;
which may God avert.”<a name="Anchor_477" id="Anchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 477.">[477]</a> Ten months later the young King’s
uncle, Earl William of Salisbury, was forbidden to hold a
tournament for which he was making preparations at
Northampton, “till by God’s help and the counsel of our faithful
men, and of yourself” (Salisbury), “the state of peace in
our realm shall be made firmer and more secure.”<a name="Anchor_478" id="Anchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 478.">[478]</a> Similar
prohibitions occur again and again;<a name="Anchor_479" id="Anchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 479.">[479]</a> but they were ineffectual,
by 1220 the condemned practice had become so general that,
according to one monastic chronicler, “tourneyers, their
aiders and abettors, and those who carried merchandise or
victuals to tournaments were ordered to be all together
excommunicated every Sunday.”<a name="Anchor_480" id="Anchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 480.">[480]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1218</div>

<p>Other restless spirits seem to have found occupation in
persecuting the Jews. In March, 1218, the Jews of Gloucester,
Lincoln, Oxford, and Bristol were placed under the special
charge of twenty-four citizens in each city, whose names
were to be enrolled, and who were to guard the Jews against
molestation from any one, “especially from Crusaders”;<a name="Anchor_481" id="Anchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 481.">[481]</a>
and it was probably to facilitate the duties of these guardians,
by rendering the persons under their charge distinguishable
at a glance, that the Jews were all ordered to wear, when out
of doors, two white “tablets” of linen or parchment on the
front of their upper garment.<a name="Anchor_482" id="Anchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 482.">[482]</a> These ordinances were no
doubt called forth by some unrecorded outrages whose origin
we may, from the words about “Crusaders,” gather to have
been closely connected with a matter which was now beginning
to engage more worthily the militant spirits of the
time. In November, 1215, a General Council assembled at
Rome under Innocent III had decreed a new Crusade, in
response to an appeal for succour which the King of the
Latins in Holy Land, John de Brienne, had made three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
years before. Some English barons and knights had taken
the Cross, but they had been too much occupied with the
troubles in their own land to attempt the fulfilment of their
vow till the civil war was ended. Whenever and wherever a
Crusade was preached, the ruder and more ignorant among
the votaries of the Cross, in their impatience to attack its
enemies, were too apt to begin with those who were nearest
at hand, and who were also most unpopular on other grounds
than religious ones&mdash;the Jews. It is, however, highly probable
that the general peace of the realm was the more easily
preserved during the next year or two because several of the
leading barons of both parties in the civil war now took
themselves out of the country altogether, and went to sink
their differences, for a while at least, in the common cause of
Christendom against Islam. The first of the magnates who
actually set out, it seems, were two steady loyalists, the Earls
of Chester and Ferrers, who with Brian de Lisle, John de
Lacy the constable of Chester, William de Harcourt, “and
many others,” started at the end of May or beginning of
June 1218.<a name="Anchor_483" id="Anchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 483.">[483]</a> Within a few months the Earl of Arundel,<a name="Anchor_484" id="Anchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 484.">[484]</a>
Baldwin de Vere, Geoffrey de Lucy, Odonel the son of
William d’Aubigny,<a name="Anchor_485" id="Anchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 485.">[485]</a> and the king’s half-brother Oliver,<a name="Anchor_486" id="Anchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 486.">[486]</a> all
took the Cross, and so did two of the leaders of the other
party&mdash;Robert FitzWalter and Saer de Quincy, Earl of
Winchester.<a name="Anchor_487" id="Anchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 487.">[487]</a> Saer died <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1219</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> in Holy Land,<a name="Anchor_488" id="Anchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 488.">[488]</a> and so did Baldwin
de Vere; Robert FitzWalter came home in broken health,<a name="Anchor_489" id="Anchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 489.">[489]</a>
and seems thenceforth to have withdrawn from public life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1217</div>

<p>Still there remained men of both parties whom it was hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
to bring or keep under control. Throughout Henry’s
minority his guardians found themselves at intervals in
difficulties with certain men who “presumed to keep in their
hands, contrary to the King’s prohibition and the will of the
owners, castles and lands belonging to some of the bishops
and magnates”<a name="Anchor_490" id="Anchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 490.">[490]</a>&mdash;and, the chronicler might have added, to
the King himself. The earliest case of flagrant insubordination
in this respect was that of Robert de Gouy. In 1215
Bishop Hugh of Lincoln had delivered to King John the
castles belonging to his see, to be garrisoned for and by the
King during his struggle with the rebel barons. One of
these castles, Newark, was given in charge by John to
Robert de Gouy, on condition of an oath sworn by Robert
that in case of John’s death he would surrender the place to
no one save the bishop.<a name="Anchor_491" id="Anchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 491.">[491]</a> Two months later John died in
that very castle. On 10th June, 1217, Robert was by letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
patent ordered to deliver Newark to its rightful owner.<a name="Anchor_492" id="Anchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 492.">[492]</a> It
seems to have been anticipated that he might plead his oath
to John as binding him to surrender the place only to the
bishop in person; Henry de Coleville, a knight holding land
under the see of Lincoln, was sent by the bishop to Newark,
accredited by letters under the bishop’s seal authorizing him
to receive the castle in the bishop’s stead, and also carrying
letters from the Legate certifying that he, Gualo, was responsible
for the bishop’s detention in London on business of
state. Robert, however, refused to deliver Newark to
Henry de Coleville, partly, it seems, on the ground of his
oath, partly on the plea that the Crown owed him some
money. On 23rd June the Council in the King’s name
promised that if this latter plea should prove to be just,
Robert’s claims should be satisfied, provided that he delivered
Newark to Coleville without further delay.<a name="Anchor_493" id="Anchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 493.">[493]</a> This second
summons had to be followed up by a third, on 23rd July,
insisting that Robert should either at once obey, or come
before the King’s Court at Oxford on 5th August, to hear
and do what the Council should determine.<a name="Anchor_494" id="Anchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 494.">[494]</a> The Council’s
decision appears to have simply confirmed the mandate of
23rd June; on 13th August De Gouy is told that he has
made himself liable to a very severe sentence by his contempt
of the judgement of the King’s Court in still retaining Newark,
but, in consideration of his long service to the late King and
the present one, his claim shall be satisfied if he will without
fail come and stand to the judgement of the King’s Court
concerning the castle on 31st August at Oxford.<a name="Anchor_495" id="Anchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 495.">[495]</a> It was,
however, not till 26th October that Robert made a formal
surrender of Newark into the hands of the King himself, for
the Bishop of Lincoln, and took an oath that within forty
days he would clear the place of himself and his men and
deliver it bodily to the bishop in person or to whomsoever
the bishop should delegate for that purpose; and also that in
the meantime he would do no harm or damage to any of the
bishop’s men, lands, or goods. The constables of Lincoln
and Nottingham (the two nearest royal castles) were bidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
to enforce full amends for any infraction of this last promise;<a name="Anchor_496" id="Anchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 496.">[496]</a>
a detail which seems to imply that Robert was suspected of
being actuated by personal ill-will towards the bishop.
Three months passed<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>1218<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>, and Newark was still occupied by
Robert and his men. Then, on 27th January, 1218, the
temporalities of the see of Lincoln were committed&mdash;having
apparently been placed in the King’s hand by the bishop
specially to that intent&mdash;to two laymen, and the constables
of its castles, Banbury, Sleaford, and Newark, were ordered
to resign their respective charges to the new custodians.<a name="Anchor_497" id="Anchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 497.">[497]</a>
Again Robert de Gouy disobeyed the royal order; and on
14th March the sheriff of Nottingham (Philip Marc) was
bidden to join the Bishop of Lincoln in driving him out of
Newark by force.<a name="Anchor_498" id="Anchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 498.">[498]</a> Either their joint attempt failed, or the
bishop shrank from this extreme measure; at last, on 4th
July, the Earl Marshal took upon himself to subdue the
obstinate rebel, and summoned thirty miners from Gloucestershire
to meet him at Stamford, where the royal forces were
to muster for the siege of Newark.<a name="Anchor_499" id="Anchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 499.">[499]</a> He and the King left
London on July 8th; on the 20th they reached Newark, and
next day they wrote to the mayor of Lincoln for materials
needed for the siege.<a name="Anchor_500" id="Anchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 500.">[500]</a> The Marshal apparently saw no
occasion for superintending its conduct in person; on the
23rd he and the King withdrew to Leicester, and by the 26th
they were in Oxfordshire.<a name="Anchor_501" id="Anchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 501.">[501]</a> Probably before they left
Newark their military demonstration had done its work in
frightening Robert sufficiently to make him offer terms, not
indeed to the government, but to the Bishop of Lincoln.
Some friends of Robert’s made overtures of peace to Hugh;
Hugh agreed to pay Robert a hundred pounds for the provisions
in the castle, and Robert apparently evacuated it
forthwith.<a name="Anchor_502" id="Anchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 502.">[502]</a> On 27th July he made formal surrender of it
into the hand of the King in person, at Wallingford, and the
King committed it to the custody of the Bishop of Winchester,
who was to do with it whatever the Legate should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
direct.<a name="Anchor_503" id="Anchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 503.">[503]</a> No doubt it was restored to the Bishop of Lincoln.
Robert de Gouy was struck dead by lightning at <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Neot’s
before the year was out.<a name="Anchor_504" id="Anchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 504.">[504]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1218</div>

<p>As the second year of little Henry’s reign drew to a close,
his guardians seem to have felt it time to make arrangements
for securing that the validity of acts done and orders issued
in his name should no longer be dependent on any individual,
even though that individual were the Governor of King and
Kingdom or the Legate. It is probable that a change in the
legation was known to be impending,<a name="Anchor_505" id="Anchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 505.">[505]</a> and also that the
physical strength of the aged Marshal was beginning to give
way under the strain of his great labours and responsibilities,
when the making of a new royal seal was entrusted to a
goldsmith named Walter “of the Hithe.” The seal was of
silver, of the weight of five marks.<a name="Anchor_506" id="Anchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 506.">[506]</a> It was first used on
3rd or 4th November, 1218, to authenticate an ordinance specially
designed to guard against a possible misuse of it during the
King’s minority. Letters patent were issued warning all men
that no grant in perpetuity was to be sealed with it till the
King’s coming of age, and that any such grant found thus
sealed should be null and void.<a name="Anchor_507" id="Anchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 507.">[507]</a> It was probably on the
same occasion that the Bishop of Winchester, the Chancellor,
the Justiciar, and “the King’s common council” made oath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
in the Legate’s presence that they would “keep and hold the
King in seisin of all the lands which were in the hand of his
father, King John, on the day when war was first begun
between him and his barons of England, and that nothing
should be done in the way of granting or alienating any land
so that it should be ceded to any man in perpetuity so long
as the King was under age.”<a name="Anchor_508" id="Anchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 508.">[508]</a> The letter patent concerning
the use of the seal was attested by the Legate, the Archbishops
Stephen of Canterbury&mdash;who had returned from Rome in
May<a name="Anchor_509" id="Anchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 509.">[509]</a>&mdash;and Walter of York, the Justiciar, and a number of
other prelates and nobles.<a name="Anchor_510" id="Anchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 510.">[510]</a> Its attestation must have been
almost the last of Gualo’s public acts in England. His work
there was done, and well done; he wished to resign his office;
and the Pope, who had other work for him elsewhere, had
accepted his resignation. In the last week of November he
set out on his homeward journey.<a name="Anchor_511" id="Anchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 511.">[511]</a> A few days later a new
Legate came to take his place.<a name="Anchor_512" id="Anchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 512.">[512]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1219</div>

<p>At Candlemas, 1219, the Marshal fell sick. The court was
then in London; but he seems to have been absent from it
for a few days when he was taken ill, for his biographer says
he “rode to London in pain.”<a name="Anchor_513" id="Anchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 513.">[513]</a> There, with his wife, he
lodged in the Tower&mdash;still, despite increasing illness, attending
to the duties of his office&mdash;till the middle of March, when,
feeling that the end was drawing near, he sent for his son and
his men and “spoke comfortable words to them, as he well
knew how.” By the advice of “several who loved him
heartily,” he made his will, deliberately and carefully. Then
he asked his son and Henry FitzGerold to carry him to his
manor of Caversham, “for he thought he could bear his
sickness more easily in his own house, and if he were to die,
it were better that he should be at home than elsewhere.”
They carried him thither in a boat, his wife accompanying
him in another boat.<a name="Anchor_514" id="Anchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 514.">[514]</a> The court seems to have immediately
removed from London to Reading, probably as the most
convenient place where the Council could all assemble within
such a distance of Caversham as enabled them to keep in
constant communication with him.<a name="Anchor_515" id="Anchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 515.">[515]</a> To the King and the
Council at Reading he sent a message, asking that they would
all come to speak with him; and they came. “Simply they
sat around him” while he spoke to the King: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>“Fair sweet
sir, in presence of these barons I wish to tell you that when
your father died and you were crowned, it was arranged that
you should be given into my charge, and so you were, that I
should defend your land, which is not easy to hold. I have
served you, I can truly say, loyally and to the uttermost of
my power; and I would serve you yet, if it pleased God to
enable me; but every one can see it is not His Will that I
should abide longer in this world. Wherefore it is fitting, so
please you, that our baronage choose some one who shall
guard you and the realm in such a way, if he can, as to please
both God and men. And may God grant you to have such
a master as may be to our honour!” Up rose the Bishop of
Winchester and spoke: “Hearken now! Marshal, the land
was given you to hold and the realm to maintain, I grant it;
but the King was given to me.” “Out upon you!” said the
Marshal, “Lord Bishop, that saying is wrong; you should
have held your peace. You were never concerned in this
matter. The time is not very long since you and the good
Earl of Chester besought me with tears that I would be
guardian and master of the King and the kingdom both
together; your memory is short, meseems; and the Legate
was at great pains about the matter, and begged and
commanded me, till from you all, together with him, I
received the King and the kingdom. And when I had
received the King, it was well seen and heard, I assure you,
that I gave the King into your hand, for he could not go
travelling about; therefore I gave him to you to take care of
him.” Here, seized with sudden pain, he turned to the Legate:
“Go now, and take the King with you; and to-morrow, if
you please, be good enough to return. I will take counsel
with my son and my people, and provide some one to undertake
the business; and may God guide our counsels
aright!”</p>

<p>Next morning he called his son, his wife, his nephew John,
and his most trusted advisers, and told them his project:
that the King “should be committed to God and the Pope,
and to the Legate.” “For in no land are the folk of so many
different minds as in England; and if I committed him to
one, the others, you may be sure, would be envious.” “If
the land be not defended by the Pope at the present juncture,
then I know not who should defend it.” To this they all
agreed. So when the King, the Legate and the great men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
came again, “the Marshal raised himself on his side, and
called the King, and took him by the hand, and said to the
Legate: ‘Sir, I have thought long and carefully about what
we spoke of yesterday. I will commit my lord here into the
Hand of God, and into the hand of the Pope, and into yours,
you being here in the Pope’s stead.’ Then he said to the
King: ‘Sir, I pray the Lord God that, if I have ever done
anything that pleased Him, He may grant you to be a brave
and good man; and if you should go astray in the footsteps
of any evil ancestor and become like to such, then I pray God,
the Son of Mary, that He give you not long life, but grant
you to die at once.’ ‘Amen,’ answered the King.” Another
attack of pain seems to have compelled the Marshal again
hurriedly to dismiss the assembly: but he at once sent his
eldest son after them, that he might formally deliver the King,
“in the sight of the baronage,” to the Legate, in order that
no man should be able to say this thing was done in a corner.
The young Marshal fulfilled his commission; taking the King
by the hand, “in the sight of all he offered him to the
Legate. But the Bishop of Winchester sprang up and took
the child by the head. ‘Let be, my Lord Bishop!’ said the
young Marshal, ‘concern yourself not with this matter; I
wish it to be seen that I fulfill all my father’s command.’”
The Legate rose up to receive the King, and sternly rebuked
Peter.<a name="Anchor_516" id="Anchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 516.">[516]</a></p>

His biographer represents him as stating in October, 1216, that he was
“over eighty,” see above, <a href="#Page_6" title="Go to page 6.">p. 6</a>; but this seems to be an error on the part of
either the writer or the Marshal himself; see <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="L’Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal">Hist. G. le Mar.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="3">iii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="24">xxiv.</abbr>

<cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="L’Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal">Hist. G. le Mar.</abbr></i></cite>, <abbr title="lines">ll.</abbr> 815–1106. I am compelled to differ from the illustrious
editor of the <i>Histoire</i> respecting this “affair of Drincourt,” which he
regards as a fantastic version of what the <cite><i>Gesta Henrici</i></cite> and <cite>Robert of Torigny</cite>
relate as having taken place there in 1173. To my mind, the divergences pointed
out in <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Meyer’s own footnote to <cite id="Footnote_331a"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="L’Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal">Hist. G. le Mar.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="3">iii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 16</cite>, and in his
introduction, <cite><i><a href="#Footnote_331a" title="Go to citation in Footnote 331.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="28">xxviii.</abbr></cite>, indicate plainly that the poet and the prose writers are
speaking of two distinct events; and this indication is confirmed by the fact that
the poet brings his story of Drincourt into immediate connexion with the knighting
of the Marshal (<abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr> <cite><abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Meyer’s note 3, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="3">iii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="26">xxvi.</abbr></cite>). This “most puzzling
passage in the whole poem” need not puzzle us at all, if we will but accept it
literally; <i>i.e.</i>, as relating to an otherwise unrecorded episode in the strife between
Henry and Louis, about the Vexin and other matters, which went on&mdash;intermittently
indeed and with long intervals of peace, but still never wholly laid to rest&mdash;through
fully ten years prior to the crowning of the “young king.” The episode
was obviously one of no great consequence, except to the Marshal, who probably
cherished its memory as that of the first real fight in which he was privileged to
take a share. Its non-appearance in the other records of the time is therefore no
proof of its unreality. The names of the chief actors on the French side&mdash;the
Count of Flanders and his brother Matthew, Count of Boulogne&mdash;are no doubt an
“anachronism,” dragged in, by a very natural confusion of memory on the part of
the poet’s informants, from the later “affair of Drincourt” in 1173. For the
incident itself, apart from this error as to some of the persons concerned in it,
more than one possible date might be suggested which would fit in well enough
with the place given to the affair in the string of the poet’s narrative.

This fact is too self-evident to need illustration, but it is well illustrated by
an incident of the late spring or early summer of 1217. Some person or persons
unnamed “urgently entreated” Honorius to take measures for the appointment of
Earl Ranulf of Chester as colleague to the Earl Marshal, whom they represented
as being too old to fulfil the duties of his office, “especially in these times.”
The proposal did not commend itself to the Pope; but he remitted the matter to
Gualo’s judgment (<cite><i><abbr title="Royal">Roy.</abbr> Letters</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 532</cite>, Honorius to Gualo, 8th July, 1217),
and it seems to have been heard of no more. How or with whom the suggestion
originated there is nothing to show. That it had not come from the Legate is
clear from the wording of the Pope’s letter to him. It evidently did not come
from the Marshal himself, although, as has been seen, he had originally proposed
that the regency should be given to Chester. There is no sign that it was the
outcome of any intrigue on the part of Chester, whose conduct seems never to
have in any way belied the assurance of loyal support which he had given to the
Marshal in October, 1216.

In the very rare cases which form an exception to this rule it is the Legate
whose seal takes the place of the Marshal’s. One of these exceptional cases is so
interesting as to deserve special notice. It consists of two letters patent, both
dated Bristol, 2nd December, 1216, attested by the King himself, and sealed with
the seals of the Legate and the Bishop of Winchester (<cite><i><abbr title="Patent">Pat.</abbr> Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 9, 10</cite>).
One of these letters is addressed to the Justiciar of Ireland, Geoffrey de Marsh,
the other to Meiler FitzHenry; the purpose of both is to secure for the Marshal his
rights in Ireland as lord of Leinster, especially the service due to him from Meiler,
which the late King had (in one of his fits of suspiciousness) taken into his own
hand as security for the Marshal’s fidelity. The reason why these letters were not
attested by the Marshal himself is obvious; but the interesting point in the matter
is that the Legate and the Bishop, or the boy-King, or all three together, seem to
have seized upon the occasion as an opportunity for putting on record the estimation
in which they held him. Each letter contains a sort of parenthesis, quite
unnecessary to its main purport, in praise of Earl William. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui</span>” writes Henry
to Geoffrey “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">patri nostro viventi semper fideliter astitit, et nobis assistit, et cujus
fidelitatem plurimum commendamus</span>”; while in the letter to Meiler there is a yet
more unconventional and emphatic outburst of feeling&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ipse enim W. semper
patri nostro viventi fideliter astitit, et devote et nobis constanter adheret et assistit,
et ipsius obsequium pre cunctis regni nostri magnatibus habemus plurimum commendatum,
quoniam tamquam aurum in fornace, sic se in necessitate probavit</span>.”

There is not a particle of evidence that these men had ever given just cause
for resentment to any English party or person. “They cannot be described as
royal favourites, for not one of them received a grant of land in perpetuity by
royal charter. Nor can they be included among the King’s political advisers; for
if they had been such they would certainly have witnessed his charters occasionally.
Yet not one of them witnessed a royal charter except Engelard de
Cigogné; and he witnessed but one before the issue of the Great Charter at
Runnymede, and but two afterwards. They were neither courtiers nor politicians,
but soldiers of experience, whom the barons feared with good cause.” <cite>Turner,

Bréauté is in Normandy, Maulay in Gascony. Of Falkes we shall have to
speak at length later on. Peter de Maulay is (like Falkes) said to have begun life
as an usher or doorkeeper: “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">Chil Pieres de Maulay ot este huissiers le roi, mais

As Mr. Turner truly says (<cite><abbr title="part">pt.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 276, 277</cite>):&mdash;“The confidence which King
John and the advisers of his son Henry reposed in these so-called alien sheriffs
rested on experience. Not one of them could boast of illustrious ancestry”
(Savaric is not included among those of whom Mr. Turner is here speaking) “or
inherited wealth; not one of them can fairly be described as a royal favourite.
Men of action, soldiers brought from France to defend their King and his kingdom,
they owed their positions to their military talents. These men from the King’s
dominions across the sea helped in no small measure to place the heir of the
Angevin house safely on the throne of England.”

The various accounts of the money paid (or promised) to Louis are extremely
puzzling. <cite>The Chronicle of Melrose, <abbr title="anno">a.</abbr> 1217, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 131</cite>, gives the total as ten
thousand pounds. <cite>The Dunstable Annals, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 51</cite>, say that Louis left his Marshal
in England “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro quindecim millibus marcarum recipiendo, quas pro reragiis tenseriarum
et expensis quas fecerat promiserunt</span>”&mdash;this verb has no nominative, but
the king’s guardians seem to be meant. The <cite id="Footnote_412a"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire des Ducs de Normandie">Hist. Ducs</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 204</cite>, after summarizing
the treaty, says Louis was to have “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">deseure tout chou, <abbr title="10">x</abbr> <abbr title="mille">m.</abbr> marcs
d’estrelins por l’arierage de ses rentes que il n’ot pas euues, et pour la desconfiture
de Nicole <abbr title="7">vii</abbr> <abbr title="mille">m.</abbr> mars; che fu <abbr title="17">xvii</abbr> <abbr title="mille">m.</abbr> mars par tout</span>.” (For the first <i lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">marcs</i> the
<abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> followed in the printed text has <i lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">livres</i>, but the other has <i lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">marcs</i>, which is
obviously the right reading; see <cite>the editor’s note 1, <i><a href="#Footnote_412a" title="Go to citation in Footnote 412.">l.c.</a></i></cite>). <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Petit-Dutaillis,
<cite id="Footnote_412b"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vie de Louis <abbr title="8">VIII</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 176, note 2</cite>, takes the marks promised to Louis as marks
sterling. But the document on which he relies for this interpretation of the sum
(<cite><i><a href="#Footnote_412b" title="Go to citation in Footnote 412.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 512</cite>) is a statement of the king’s debt to Florence of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Omer, not of his
debt to Louis. The letter of 6th November, 1218, which does specify the sum
due to Louis, says nothing about marks sterling; it calls them simply “marks.”
Reading <cite>the Dunstable Annals</cite> and the <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire des Ducs de Normandie">Hist. Ducs</abbr></i></cite> by the light of the king’s
letter, one is led to think that the monk’s “fifteen thousand marks” are made up
of the king’s ten thousand marks “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro bono pacis</span>” (= “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro expensis quas
fecerat [Ludovicus]</span>” = “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">pour la desconfiture de Nicole</span>”), and five (instead of
seven) thousand “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro reragiis</span>,” “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">pour l’arierage de ses rentes</span>,” the amounts given
for the indemnity and for the arrears having been reversed (and the latter perhaps
exaggerated) by the Flemish historian.

<abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 34, 35</cite>, as follows: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erant autem his diebus multi in Anglia quibus
tempore belli praeteriti dulcissimum fuerat de rapinis vixisse, unde nunc post
pacem denuntiatam et omnibus concessam non potuerunt manus a praeda cohibere;
horum autem principales fuerunt incentores Willelmus comes Albemarliae, Falcasius
cum suis castellanis, Robertus de Veteriponte, Brienus de Insula, Hugo de
Baillul, Philippus Marci, et Robertus de Gaugi, cum aliis multis, qui castella
quorundam episcoporum ac magnatum cum terris et possessionibus contra regis
prohibitionem et illorum voluntatem detinere praesumpserunt eisdem; inter quos
Robertus de Gaugi, post multas regis admonitiones, castellum de Newerc cum
villa tota et pertinentiis, quae ad jus Hugonis Lincolniensis episcopi spectabant,
ei reddere contradixit.</span>” Mr. Turner (<cite id="Footnote_490a">“Minority,” part <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>, <i>Trans. Roy. Hist.
Soc.</i>, 3rd <abbr title="series">ser.</abbr> <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 221–222</cite>) has shown that not only up to this date, but for
several years after, there is no evidence on this subject against Falkes, and that
there is none whatever, at any date, against Brian de Lisle, Philip Marc, and Robert
de Vipont. Hugh de Balliol really was contumacious, and so too, though as yet
in a much lesser degree, was William of Aumale (<cite><i><a href="#Footnote_490a" title="Go to citation in Footnote 490.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 223, 237</cite>). It is quite clear
that, as Mr. Turner says (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 222</cite>), Roger’s account of the Newark affair was written
some years after the occurrence, and that Roger “had in mind the events of the
years 1224 and 1225 when he was writing of 1218.” A hint of this confusion lurks
in a detail which seems to have escaped Mr. Turner’s notice. Roger, immediately
before the passage quoted above, says that Henry kept Christmas, 1217 (1218, in
Roger’s reckoning), at Northampton with Falkes. But as a matter of fact Henry
kept that Christmas at Gloucester; see above, <a href="#Page_91" title="Go to page 91.">p. 91</a>. Obviously Roger was
confusing the Christmas of 1217 with that of 1223, the one which immediately
preceded the redistribution of royal castles in 1224, and which Henry really did
spend at Northampton, though not as Falkes’s guest.

Gualo had certainly sent in his resignation to the Pope; it was on 12th September,
1218, that Honorius appointed Pandulf legate to England, Gualo having

On 3rd September, 1220, Henry writes to Almeric of Limoges: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sciatis

<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 163</cite>. It is possible that this transaction, of which I have found no other
mention, may have taken place at the council of Bristol in November, 1217; but
if it had we should have expected the Marshal to be named among those who
took the oath. The date which I have suggested for it seems therefore more
probable.

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> new Legate was not a stranger to England. His first
recorded visit there had taken place in 1211. He was then
in subdeacon’s orders, and a member of the household of
Pope Innocent III.<a name="Anchor_519" id="Anchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 519.">[519]</a> Of his earlier life nothing is known,
except that he was a Roman by birth;<a name="Anchor_520" id="Anchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 520.">[520]</a> but King John seems
to have already had some indirect knowledge of him, for it
was at John’s request that he and another papal envoy, a
brother of the Temple, were appointed by Innocent to go and
confer with the King of England for the restoration of peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
to the English Church.<a name="Anchor_521" id="Anchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 521.">[521]</a> In the one interview which took
place between the commissioners and the King, Pandulf was
the spokesman on the papal side; and John found that he
had mistaken his man. The subdeacon simply stated the
terms which he was instructed to offer to John; a long
argument ensued, in which John was worsted; but he still
refused to submit, whereupon Pandulf told him to his face, in
the presence of all the court, that the Pope meant to subdue
him and had already excommunicated him and absolved his
subjects from their allegiance, and that the sentence was to
take effect from that day forth. “If I had not sent for you,
I would make you ride about my realm for a year!” raved
the King. “You might as well say you would hang us,” coolly
answered Pandulf; “we look for no other reward from you”;
and when John tried to frighten him by issuing in his presence
orders for the mutilation and execution of sundry prisoners,
one of whom was a priest, the only result was that Pandulf
went to fetch a candle for the avowed purpose of formally
excommunicating then and there any person who should lay
hands on this particular victim, and that John, evidently
alarmed lest the candle should be used against himself as well
as against his officers, hurried after the dauntless subdeacon
and surrendered the man to his judgement.<a name="Anchor_522" id="Anchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 522.">[522]</a> Thenceforth
Pandulf became the Pope’s special confidant and assistant in
all matters relating to England and its King. It was he who
in January, 1213, carried to Philip Augustus the Pope’s letter
charging Philip with the execution of the sentence of
deprivation against John; and it was he alone who shared with
the Pope the secret of the negotiations which were then
already afoot for rendering Philip’s expedition needless.
Four months later he was in England again, receiving, in the
Pope’s behalf, first John’s assent to the identical terms which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
he had refused in 1211, and secondly the King’s homage to the
Roman See for the realms of England and Ireland.<a name="Anchor_523" id="Anchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 523.">[523]</a></p>

<p>After a hurried visit to France, to stop the intended
invasion from thence,<a name="Anchor_524" id="Anchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 524.">[524]</a> Pandulf returned to England, and
remained there till the beginning of the next year. His
position during this time is somewhat difficult to define. His
official rank was merely that of “the Pope’s messenger”;<a name="Anchor_525" id="Anchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 525.">[525]</a>
he had never held a commission as Legate; and the distinction
between the two offices was clearly marked when
in September, 1213, an envoy of higher standing in the Curia,
Nicolas, Cardinal Bishop of Tusculum, came clothed with
the full powers of a Legate <i>a latere</i> to receive a repetition
of John’s homage to Rome, and to raise the Interdict as soon
as the bishops and clergy should have been compensated for
their losses and wrongs. Certain payments made to Pandulf
on the King’s behalf seem to indicate that he was the
authorized receiver of the earliest instalments of the tribute
to Rome.<a name="Anchor_526" id="Anchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 526.">[526]</a> John had already made a friend of the man who
had withstood him in 1211; the Pope’s clerk was taken into
the counsels of the King; “We have granted to Master
Pandulf that a truce be made between ourself and the Welsh,”
wrote John to the Marcher barons in July, 1213;<a name="Anchor_527" id="Anchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 527.">[527]</a> and when
Pandulf went oversea in January, 1214, he went as “the King’s
messenger”<a name="Anchor_528" id="Anchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 528.">[528]</a>&mdash;whether to France or to Rome, there is nothing
to shew with certainty; but it is probable that he carried some
of the tribute money to the Pope. He seems to have been
back in England by the end of the year, when the recall
of Nicolas of Tusculum left him once more sole representative
of the Pope in England, but still without any higher title than
before. In the spring of 1215 he and the Bishop of Chichester
conjointly were delegated by the Pope to investigate the
merits of a project for dissolving the union between the see
of Bath and the abbey of Glastonbury.<a name="Anchor_529" id="Anchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 529.">[529]</a> In the preamble to
the Great Charter <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>“Master Pandulf, the Pope’s subdeacon
and familiar,” stands with the Master of the Temple between
the bishops and the lay magnates in the list of the King’s
advisers; and he is the last named of the three commissioners
(the other two being the Bishop of Winchester and the Abbot
of Reading) to whom the Pope addressed his letter ordering
that the “disturbers of King and kingdom” should be
proclaimed excommunicate by the bishops. If any of these
latter failed to obey the order, the commissioners themselves
were empowered to suspend the recalcitrant prelates; and
thus it fell to the lot of Pandulf and Bishop Peter to
proclaim the suspension of Archbishop Stephen.<a name="Anchor_530" id="Anchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 530.">[530]</a></p>

<p>Some seven or eight weeks before this, Pandulf had been&mdash;of
course on the King’s recommendation&mdash;elected to the
bishopric of Norwich;<a name="Anchor_531" id="Anchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 531.">[531]</a> but no steps towards his consecration
were taken for more than six years. Shortly after the middle of
September, 1215, he seems to have gone to Rome on a mission
from John, who wrote to the Pope that “although Master
Pandulf is most useful to us in England, inasmuch as he
labours faithfully and devotedly for the honour of the
Roman Church and of ourself and our whole realm, yet
we send him to your Holiness because we can trust no one
else to explain the state of ourself and our realm so well as
he can do it.”<a name="Anchor_532" id="Anchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 532.">[532]</a> We find no further trace of Pandulf for
nearly two years. It is doubtful whether he had returned to
England before John’s death; Gualo had been residing there
as Legate since May, 1216, and the subdeacon’s presence was
therefore no longer necessary for the interests of either Pope
or King. In July, 1218, he was at Rome, acting as notary to
the Pope.<a name="Anchor_533" id="Anchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 533.">[533]</a> On 12th September Honorius appointed him
to the office which Gualo had just resigned;<a name="Anchor_534" id="Anchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 534.">[534]</a> and on 2nd
December he was formally welcomed as Legate in <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul’s
cathedral in London.<a name="Anchor_535" id="Anchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 535.">[535]</a></p>

<p>Pandulf had well earned his promotion; and the special
appropriateness of his appointment as Legate in England
was obvious. His qualifications for the post may be summed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
up in an adaptation of the words in which John had commended
him to Honorius: there was no one in the Roman
Curia who could be trusted to understand and manage the
affairs of John’s heir and of his realm so well as this man
whom King and Pope alike had found by experience to be
“most useful, faithful, and devoted” to the interests of both.
As Legate, Pandulf came to his task in far less difficult
circumstances than Gualo had done. Even when he set out
from Rome, however, there must have been a general
consciousness that the new Legate would ere long have to
take upon him another charge, with which his predecessor
had never been burdened. The selection of an English noble,
instead of the legal representative of the overlord of England,
as governor of King and kingdom in 1216 had been
occasioned by circumstances which in 1218 had ceased to
exist. There was now no invader to expel, no rebellion to
subdue, no need for a warrior-regent: and there was also no
man among the baronage clearly marked out for the regent’s
office as the Marshal had been by his personal qualities and
by the universal estimation of his fellow barons. It is only
fair to the English magnates to say that there are no indications
of rivalry among them for the reversion of the regent’s
office; but there can be no doubt that, as the Marshal
himself foresaw, the appointment of any one of them as his
successor must inevitably have led to jealousy and discord,
and that the only person who could safely take the foremost
place in the government after him was the representative of
the Apostolic See. The matter might indeed not have been
settled without difficulty, had its settlement been postponed
till after the Marshal’s death. His forethought and his
influence averted the danger, and from the day when he
transferred the custody of the King to Pandulf at Reading
the Legate was recognized as chief among the guardians of
little Henry and his realm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1219</div>

<p>Pandulf’s supremacy, however, was of a different character
from that of the Earl Marshal. Theoretically, it was more
absolute, for the powers which had appertained respectively
to the Marshal and to Gualo were united in his person; he
was at once the elected regent of the realm and the representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
of its overlord. But practically his rule was less
absolute, because he had the good sense to recognize from
the outset that the direction of the entire home and foreign
policy of England, and of its internal government, was a
charge too great for a foreign ecclesiastic to undertake single-handed.
He did not assume the title of “ruler of King and
kingdom”; and he shared the functions of that office with
the Justiciar and the Bishop of Winchester. He took but
little part in the routine of administrative business; he is
seldom found attesting royal letters; he left such matters to
Hubert and Peter. From the very beginning of his regency,
however&mdash;even before the death of the Marshal&mdash;he claimed
an exclusive right of supreme control over one department of
royal administration: the treasury. This appears from some
letters written by him from the west of England to the
treasurer Eustace de Fauconberg and the vice-chancellor
Ralf de Neville in London, in the spring of the year 1219.<a name="Anchor_536" id="Anchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 536.">[536]</a>
Soon after the council at Reading, Pandulf went to reside for
some weeks first at Cirencester, and afterwards at the abbey
of Lantony at Gloucester. On 30th April he wrote from
Cirencester to Eustace and Ralf conjointly: “By our
authority as Legate we lay upon you strict injunctions to
give all attention and diligence to the business of the
Exchequer; to deposit what money you can get in the house
of the Temple in London, and to pay nothing of it out to
anybody without our special command and licence; and we
strictly forbid that the seal be withdrawn from the Exchequer
at the bidding of anyone.”<a name="Anchor_537" id="Anchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 537.">[537]</a> At the same time he wrote a
separate letter to Ralf, ordering him “not to withdraw from
the Exchequer with the seal at anyone’s bidding, because the
proceedings of the Exchequer and the advantage of the King
would be hindered thereby.”<a name="Anchor_538" id="Anchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 538.">[538]</a> On 10th May he “warned
and exhorted” Ralf to “attend faithfully and devotedly to
the King’s business, and especially the business of the
Exchequer which is at present imminent.”<a name="Anchor_539" id="Anchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 539.">[539]</a> In subsequent
letters to Ralf he emphatically reiterated his orders to store<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
up money in the Temple and to let none of it be paid out
“without our knowledge and command”; on one occasion
giving as a reason that “as you well know, the King is burdened
with many debts.”<a name="Anchor_540" id="Anchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 540.">[540]</a> On 16th May he so far relaxed
his injunction to Ralf about not quitting the Exchequer as to
give him leave “the holy blissful Martyr for to seek,”<a name="Anchor_541" id="Anchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 541.">[541]</a> if he
wished it, and if there was nothing that needed to be done at
the Exchequer; “but,” he added, “make haste back, and
deposit the King’s seal under your own in the Temple till you
return”; and on 26th May he again told the vice-chancellor
not to leave the Exchequer “at the bidding of any man.”<a name="Anchor_542" id="Anchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 542.">[542]</a></p>

<p>It is not certain whether the seal referred to in these letters
is the King’s great seal or its duplicate the seal of the
Exchequer. Nominally, the custody of both these seals
appertained to the Chancellor; but since the latter years of
Henry <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr> a large part of the Chancellor’s duties, including the
keeping of the great seal, had been usually delegated to a
vice-chancellor; and the whole of them were left in the
capable and trusty hands of Ralf de Neville throughout the
greater part of the chancellorship of Richard de Marsh, which
lasted from 1214 till 1226.<a name="Anchor_543" id="Anchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 543.">[543]</a> The Exchequer seal was never
permitted to leave the precincts of the Exchequer, where it
was kept by the Chancellor “through a deputy,”<a name="Anchor_544" id="Anchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 544.">[544]</a> who doubtless
might be, but was not necessarily, identical with the vice-chancellor.
With the paying of money out of the Exchequer
neither Chancellor nor vice-chancellor, as such, had anything to
do; this was a part of the business of the treasurer and
chamberlains. It seems probable that the vice-chancellor may
have been also one of the chamberlains acting at the
Exchequer at this time.<a name="Anchor_545" id="Anchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 545.">[545]</a> It is certain that he was in Pandul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>f’s
fullest confidence;<a name="Anchor_546" id="Anchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 546.">[546]</a> and he may thus in a twofold or even
threefold capacity&mdash;as keeper of the King’s great seal, as the
Chancellor’s deputy having the custody of the Exchequer seal,
and as chamberlain&mdash;have supported Pandulf’s efforts to
maintain, as a special prerogative attached to the regent’s
office, the right of exclusive control over the Exchequer.<a name="Anchor_547" id="Anchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 547.">[547]</a>
That there was some matter under discussion between the
Legate, the Justiciar, the treasurer, and the vice-chancellor, is
clear from a letter written by Hubert de Burgh on 15th May
to Eustace and Ralf in which he says the Legate “sent us
word that he will labour altogether by our counsel for God’s
honour and the King’s advantage; and we sent him word that
if he will acquiesce in your advice, we will acquiesce in his
counsel, for God’s honour and the advantage of the King.”<a name="Anchor_548" id="Anchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 548.">[548]</a>
The constitution of the Exchequer underwent great changes
in the course of the next fifteen years; and some of these
changes may have owed their origin to Pandulf, who perhaps
made, or attempted to make, some experiments in the
re-organization of this department of the government, possibly
with a view to checking what he may have regarded as
extravagance on the Justiciar’s part in the disposal of the
King’s money. Some months later we find him exhorting
Hubert also to “take effectual steps concerning the business
of the Exchequer”;<a name="Anchor_549" id="Anchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 549.">[549]</a> and four years later one of the charges
brought against Hubert was that of having been “a waster of
the King’s treasure.”<a name="Anchor_550" id="Anchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 550.">[550]</a> There is, however, no means of ascertaining
what really lay behind Pandulf’s mysterious orders to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the vice-chancellor. If the matter was one which involved a
conflict between the authority of the regent and that of the
Justiciar, it was probably compromised, or at least decided by
an amicable agreement; it evidently led to no subsequent
friction in the council of three which virtually governed
England throughout Pandulf’s legation, and in which, while
the foremost place belonged by a double right to the Legate-regent,
the second belonged by long-established constitutional
tradition to the Justiciar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1201–1217</div>

<p>Hubert de Burgh’s reputation as a statesman had yet to be
made; but a career of distinction in more ways than one
already lay behind him. His origin is absolutely unknown.
The surname of which he and his brothers seem to be the
earliest bearers mentioned in history represents, no doubt, the
birthplace of one of their ancestors, probably their father;<a name="Anchor_551" id="Anchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 551.">[551]</a>
but whether that place was Peterborough, or Brough in
Westmorland, or one of the many Burghs and Burys in
England or of the almost as numerous “Bourgs” in
the continental dominions of the Angevin house, there
is nothing to shew. In the early years of John’s reign
Hubert’s brother William played some part in the affairs
of the Anglo-Norman March in Ireland.<a name="Anchor_552" id="Anchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 552.">[552]</a> <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1201–1205</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> Hubert himself
was in 1201 chamberlain to John,<a name="Anchor_553" id="Anchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 553.">[553]</a> and entrusted with the
wardenship of the Welsh Marches.<a name="Anchor_554" id="Anchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 554.">[554]</a> At the close of 1202
he was constable of Falaise, and had charge of the captive
Arthur of Brittany, whom he saved from John’s cruelty chiefly,
it seems, out of regard for the interests of John himself.<a name="Anchor_555" id="Anchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 555.">[555]</a> In
1204 he was constable of Chinon; he held it against the
forces of Philip Augustus for twelve months, and when at
last&mdash;long after the rest of the old Angevin lands were lost&mdash;its
walls were so shattered that further defence became
impossible, he sallied forth at the head of his men, fighting
desperately, and was only made prisoner when disabled by a
severe wound.<a name="Anchor_556" id="Anchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 556.">[556]</a> On his release he returned to his duties as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
chamberlain; and he was also sheriff of six counties at
various times during the next eight or nine years.<a name="Anchor_557" id="Anchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 557.">[557]</a> Early in
1214 John appointed him seneschal of Poitou,<a name="Anchor_558" id="Anchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 558.">[558]</a> whence he
returned in the following April with some troops for the King’s
service;<a name="Anchor_559" id="Anchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 559.">[559]</a> shortly afterwards all the King’s subjects from over
sea who obeyed his summons to come and help him against
the barons were instructed to place themselves under Hubert’s
orders.<a name="Anchor_560" id="Anchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 560.">[560]</a> In June Hubert became chief Justiciar of England.<a name="Anchor_561" id="Anchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 561.">[561]</a>
For the exercise of the Justiciar’s ordinary functions he had
little scope during the next two years; it was as constable of
Dover castle that he rendered his most important services
to John and to John’s youthful successor. From May, 1216,
till August, 1217, he was practically absorbed in one task,
the defence of Dover; and although the account of the sea
fight on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bartholomew’s day given by an historian of the
next generation,<a name="Anchor_562" id="Anchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 562.">[562]</a> which ascribes the entire credit of that
decisive victory to Hubert alone, is very far from being borne
out by contemporary and impartial authorities,<a name="Anchor_563" id="Anchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 563.">[563]</a> he undoubtedly
shewed himself on that day as brave and capable on board
ship as he had so often proved himself on land. Thus he
passed from the military to the political stage of his career
supported by the well-earned respect and goodwill of all
parties in the realm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1198–1215</div>

<p>The Bishop of Winchester’s position at the council-table
was peculiar. He had no official title and no specific
functions in the civil administration of the kingdom; his
connexion with the government was a purely personal one.
A donjon of fourteenth century construction overlooking a
hamlet built on the slope of a hill with a little stream flowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
round its foot, some twelve kilometres south of Poitiers, is
in all likelihood the successor of a castle from which Peter
des Roches and his family derived their surname. In his
youth Peter had been a knight in the service of Richard
Cœur-de-Lion;<a name="Anchor_564" id="Anchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 564.">[564]</a> and he must have shown great aptitude for
the career of a warrior, since, long after his helmet had been
replaced by a mitre, he was regarded as “learned in the
military art,” and proved himself worthy of his reputation
when he acted as “the master counsellor” of the English host
on the day of the Fair of Lincoln. When and why he
became a clerk there is nothing to shew; but he seems to
have done so shortly before or soon after Richard’s death.
In June, 1198, he was Richard’s chamberlain;<a name="Anchor_565" id="Anchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 565.">[565]</a> a year later he
was a “beloved clerk” of John’s, and treasurer of Poitou.<a name="Anchor_566" id="Anchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 566.">[566]</a>
In the favour of Richard’s successor he rose rapidly. On
3rd January, 1202, he was made dean of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin’s at
Angers;<a name="Anchor_567" id="Anchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 567.">[567]</a> but his time was spent mostly in England as a clerk
in the royal household;<a name="Anchor_568" id="Anchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 568.">[568]</a> and though he still bore the title of
treasurer of Poitou at the beginning of 1205,<a name="Anchor_569" id="Anchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 569.">[569]</a> he must have
lost the profits of all his continental dignities and offices
when the Angevin lands passed into the hands of Philip of
France. For these he was indemnified by grants of various
ecclesiastical revenues and offices in England;<a name="Anchor_570" id="Anchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 570.">[570]</a> and before
February 5th, 1205, he was elected Bishop of Winchester,<a name="Anchor_571" id="Anchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 571.">[571]</a>
the see which ranked next to the two archbishoprics in wealth
and importance. He of course owed his election to the
influence of the King; a part of the chapter had chosen
another candidate, against whom Peter had to plead at Rome
for confirmation; his pleading was successful, and he was
consecrated by Innocent III on 25th September.<a name="Anchor_572" id="Anchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 572.">[572]</a> Peter was
the one bishop who remained in England throughout the
years of interdict. In 1210, during the King’s absence in
Ireland, he joined with the Justiciar Geoffrey FitzPeter and the
Earl of Chester in an expedition into Wales which prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
a threatened Welsh invasion.<a name="Anchor_573" id="Anchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 573.">[573]</a> In October, 1213, Geoffrey
FitzPeter died; and on 1st February, 1214, John appointed
the Bishop of Winchester chief Justiciar of England.<a name="Anchor_574" id="Anchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 574.">[574]</a> The
King’s choice of a foreigner for this office is said to have
caused much grumbling among the barons,<a name="Anchor_575" id="Anchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 575.">[575]</a> the more so as
John was on the eve of quitting the realm for a military
expedition to Aquitaine, so that during his absence, which
lasted eight months, Peter was practically viceroy of England.
One chronicler asserts that Peter “by misusing his power
turned the wrath of the barons against the King”;<a name="Anchor_576" id="Anchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 576.">[576]</a> but there
is no proof that the country was any worse administered
during those eight months than it had been for several years
previously, and nothing to indicate that Peter was guilty of
personal tyranny or extortion, or, in short, that he did
anything worse than carry on the King’s government as he
found it. Nor is it by any means clear that he was really
disliked or distrusted, except by one section of the baronage&mdash;the
section whose lofty patriotism and keen sense of nationality
were soon to be displayed in their scheme for the
annexation of England to France. The substitution of
Hubert for Peter as Justiciar at Midsummer, 1215, may have
taken place in deference to the King’s other advisers; but
there is no evidence that such was the case; nothing is known
about the circumstances of Hubert’s appointment; and it is
quite possible that Peter may have resigned the justiciarship
of his own accord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1216</div>

<p>From that time forth Peter never held office as a minister
of state. He never had done so, save during those sixteen
months of his justiciarship in 1214–1215.<a name="Anchor_577" id="Anchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 577.">[577]</a> He had, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
received another token of John’s confidence; he had been
entrusted with the education of John’s heir. We have seen
that in October, 1216, the Earl Marshal, with the assent of
the other loyal barons, bestowed on Peter the important charge
of the little King’s person, expressly on the ground that he had
already been the child’s “master” and proved himself “a very
good” one, who had “brought him up carefully and well.”
As Henry was but just nine years old when these words
were spoken,<a name="Anchor_578" id="Anchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 578.">[578]</a> we must infer from them that he had been
under Peter’s care from a very tender age. Probably John
had placed him in the bishop’s household as early as it was
possible to do so, somewhat as Henry <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr> had placed his
eldest son, when quite a young child, in the household of
Thomas the Chancellor.<a name="Anchor_579" id="Anchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 579.">[579]</a> The Marshal and the magnates did
only what was natural and right when they replaced their
young sovereign under the charge of his former tutor. The
commission which Peter received from them, however, involved
more than the boy’s education; it expressly included
the responsibility for his personal safety. The man to whom
was confided a charge so weighty as this obviously needed no
official title to vindicate for him a prominent place among the
counsellors by whose advice England was to be governed in his
royal pupil’s name; and the active and versatile Southerner,
experienced and efficient alike in matters of war, of
administration, of finance, and of well-nigh every kind of
public business, secular and ecclesiastical, was a colleague
whose help the official governors of the realm would have
been foolish indeed to reject or undervalue on the score of his
foreign birth. They and he seem to have worked together
without perceptible friction throughout the regency of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Marshal. The sharp words which passed between Peter and
the regent shortly before the latter’s death, and Peter’s unseemly
behaviour to the younger Marshal and the Legate next
day, probably resulted from a misunderstanding on the part
of the bishop. He evidently thought that the proposal to
appoint a new “guardian of King and Kingdom” and the
symbolical delivery of the King into the hands of Pandulf
were meant to deprive himself of his precious charge. There
was, however, no such intention. Pandulf gave Peter the rebuke
which his violence deserved, but immediately replaced Henry
under his care.<a name="Anchor_580" id="Anchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 580.">[580]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1218–1219</div>

<p>For the first six months of Pandulf’s regency the chronicles
are blank, so far as the internal history of England is concerned.
Throughout those months, however, one man was
openly setting the government at defiance. In December,
1216<span class="sn_extra"><i>1216</i></span>, the royal castles of Rockingham and Sauvey, with
the important Forest jurisdictions attached to them,<a name="Anchor_581" id="Anchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 581.">[581]</a> had
been committed by the Earl Marshal to the custody
of William de Fors, the titular Count of Aumale<a name="Anchor_582" id="Anchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 582.">[582]</a> (or
“Albemarle,” as it seems to have been commonly called in
England), “that he might dwell in them with his men until
his own lands, which the King’s enemies had occupied during
the war, should be restored to him.”<a name="Anchor_583" id="Anchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 583.">[583]</a> The actual custodian
of Sauvey, Geoffrey de Serland, was apparently somewhat
unwilling to hand the place over to the young count;<a name="Anchor_584" id="Anchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 584.">[584]</a> and as
Geoffrey’s loyalty is unquestioned, his reluctance was probably
caused by some doubts either of William’s loyalty, or of his
fitness for the charge of such an important post. If so, these
doubts were well founded. On 11th February, 1218<span class="sn_extra"><i>1218</i></span>, William,
having received restitution of his own lands, was bidden to
deliver up Rockingham and Sauvey to another custodian.<a name="Anchor_585" id="Anchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 585.">[585]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
This order was not obeyed; and a contemporary writer asserts
that the Earl Marshal before his death “greatly repented” of
having put these castles into the young count’s hands,
“because of the complaints which arose out of the ill-doings
of the said count and his officers who dwelt there and wrought
serious injuries to the people of the district, both rich and
poor.”<a name="Anchor_586" id="Anchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 586.">[586]</a> For some unexplained reason, however, no further
steps seem to have been taken in the matter till six months
after the Marshal’s death. Then, on 30th November, 1219,<span class="sn_extra"><i>1219</i></span>
a lengthy indictment against Aumale was issued in the form
of letters patent to the barons, knights, and freeholders
of the five counties&mdash;Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Cumberland,
Rutland, Leicestershire, and Yorkshire&mdash;in which the bulk
of his possessions lay. Count William was not only detaining,
against the royal will and command, certain lands and castles
of the King’s which had been placed in his charge (to wit,
Rockingham and Sauvey), but was also fortifying and victualling
them in the King’s defiance, although a day had actually
been set&mdash;“to which he paid no heed”&mdash;for him to surrender
them to the King in person. He was also holding tournaments;
more especially he had lately held and attended one
at Brackley, contrary to the King’s express orders, and
regardless of a sentence of excommunication passed upon him
by the Legate. He was therefore to be avoided as an excommunicate
and a rebel; the persons addressed were warned,
on pain of condign punishment, not to assist him in fortifying
Sauvey, but to be ready to take action against him in whatever
way they should be directed by future letters from the
King; and the sheriffs of the five counties were ordered to
proclaim him excommunicate.<a name="Anchor_587" id="Anchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 587.">[587]</a> Strangely enough, neither
in record nor chronicle do we find any further mention of
William of Aumale till the following April<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>1220<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>, when an order
addressed to him for forty bucks to be sent to the King at
Westminster shows that he was again recognized as warden
of a royal Forest, which can only have been that of Rockingham
or Sauvey;<a name="Anchor_588" id="Anchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 588.">[588]</a> and his next appearance is in the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
June, when he was one of the sureties for King Henry’s fulfilment
of a treaty with the King of Scots.<a name="Anchor_589" id="Anchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 589.">[589]</a> He seems to have
been absolved on condition of taking the Cross<a name="Anchor_590" id="Anchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 590.">[590]</a> and of
surrendering the castles and setting forth on his crusade
within a given period. Such an arrangement would serve,
for the time being, the purposes of Count and Legate alike.
William remained in possession; Pandulf avoided, or at least
staved off for a while, the responsibility of taking forcible
measures against a man whom the Marshal had apparently
deemed it prudent to treat with forbearance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1220</div>

<p>A like forbearance was exercised towards the Justiciar of
Ireland, Geoffrey de Marsh. Shortly before the Marshal’s
death Geoffrey appears to have announced his intention of
going on Crusade;<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>1219<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> and the Council seized the opportunity
thus afforded them to insist that before he went, he must
come to England to perform his homage to the King, and
confer with them touching the state of affairs in Ireland.
For this purpose they gave him on 23rd April a safe-conduct
till All Saints’ day; and they arranged that during his
absence from Ireland the Archbishop of Dublin, who had
been his colleague in the office of Justiciar during the past
twelve months, should take sole charge of the March.<a name="Anchor_591" id="Anchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 591.">[591]</a> The
Archbishop was himself anxious to go to England for an
interview with the King; and as Geoffrey delayed his
departure, he at length wrote and asked permission to do so.<a name="Anchor_592" id="Anchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 592.">[592]</a>
His request seems to have crossed with some royal letters
issued on 22nd September, ordering that his appointment as
chief Justiciar should take effect from Candlemas next, and
that by that date Geoffrey should be in England without
fail;<a name="Anchor_593" id="Anchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 593.">[593]</a> and this order Geoffrey was just preparing to obey
when it was followed by a warm assent to the Archbishop’s
proposed visit, which the King’s advisers said “would be
most welcome for many reasons.” On this Geoffrey was
disposed to make the Archbishop’s impending departure from
Ireland a reason for again deferring his own; the Archbishop,
however, besought the King not to let him do so, but to bid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
him “commit the custody of the land, according as the
Council may provide, to some other man.”<a name="Anchor_594" id="Anchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 594.">[594]</a> The Archbishop
was certainly in England in the summer of 1220; but there
is no sign of Geoffrey’s presence there at Candlemas.
Summoned again, this time to meet the King and Council at
Nottingham on 1st June, he at last came over, but was unavoidably
prevented from being at Nottingham on the appointed
day, and begged that a later date might be fixed on which he
might “lay before the King and council the affairs of the
King’s land in Ireland, and”&mdash;thus he wrote to his “very
dear friend” Hubert de Burgh&mdash;“they may be settled by
the counsel of yourself and other of the King’s faithful men
and of our friends.”<a name="Anchor_595" id="Anchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 595.">[595]</a></p>

<p>The settlement took the form of a convention between
the King and Geoffrey, drawn up at Oxford on 11th
August, in presence of the Legate and the Archbishop of
Dublin, as well as Peter des Roches, Hubert de Burgh,
and other members of the royal council. The Justiciar
is in future to answer at the King’s Exchequer in Dublin
for escheats, wards, fines, gifts, tallages, reliefs, and aids, from
Ireland; and the proceeds of all these, after they have been
accounted for at the Exchequer, are to be rendered to the
King at his command. Out of the assessed revenue of
Ireland, and its “reasonable perquisites” other than those
above mentioned, the Justiciar is to maintain the garrisons of
the King’s land and castles in Ireland; the garrisons to be
such as shall be determined by the advice of Archbishop
Henry, Thomas FitzAdam, and Richard de Burgh. The
surplus of these revenues and perquisites shall be accounted
for at the Dublin Exchequer by the view of these three
persons; and clerks of the King, appointed for the purpose,
shall keep a counter-roll of all these things. The Justiciar
shall appoint as constables of the King’s castles loyal and fit
men who shall swear to keep the castles faithfully and safely
for the King, so that in case of the Justiciar’s capture, or death,
or misconduct, the castles shall be safe; and these constables
shall give hostages for their fidelity to the Archbishop of
Dublin and the Earl Marshal, and shall also send to the King,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
through the Archbishop, charters of fealty. The Justiciar
gave his two sons as hostages; the Earl Marshal stood pledge
for him; and he himself further pledged the whole of his
lands, to fall in to the King and the Marshal respectively (he
held some of each), in case of his failure to keep faith. He
also took an oath to keep all these promises, on pain of being
excommunicated by the Archbishop of Dublin in case of
breaking them; and as he had left his seal in Ireland for legal
purposes there, this writing was at his request sealed with the
seals of his brother William and of the Archbishop of Dublin,
until he, Geoffrey, could put his own seal to it.<a name="Anchor_596" id="Anchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 596.">[596]</a></p>

<p>From this document it must be inferred that nothing worse
than mismanagement was proved against Geoffrey. His
mismanagement however had clearly reached a point at which
any sovereign of full age, and in a position to enforce his
commands, would have put an end to it by summarily
dismissing Geoffrey from his office. But the guardians of
Henry <abbr title="the Third">III</abbr> knew that they were not in a position to enforce
the dismissal of the Justiciar whom Henry’s father had left in
charge of the March in Ireland. Geoffrey was not willing to
resign because he was not prepared to render an account of his
stewardship. If they issued a direct order for his supersession
it was highly probable that he would set them and their order
at defiance, and that he would be supported in his defiance by
the wardens of the royal castles who owed their appointments
to him. Henry could not go, as John had gone, with an
armed force at his back, to settle matters in Ireland for himself;
nor could anyone in England be sent to do so in his stead.
Should force be needed to subdue Geoffrey, the task of
subduing him could only be committed to some of the barons
of the March; and to commit it to any of these would be
to plunge the whole March into a civil war which might
result in the complete destruction of the King’s authority
there. The case against Geoffrey was clearly not strong
enough to justify Pandulf and his colleagues in taking
measures which involved such a risk. The course which they
took in giving Geoffrey another chance of redeeming his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
errors, while hedging him round with the strongest moral
restraints that could be devised to prevent a repetition of
those errors, was at once more politic and more just.</p>

<p>Pandulf’s most congenial sphere of action was diplomacy;
and at the outset of his legatine career he was called upon to
exercise his diplomatic gifts on a readjustment of the relations
between the Kings of England and Scotland. In 1218<span class="sn_extra"><i>1218</i></span>
Alexander of Scotland&mdash;seemingly with the knowledge and
assent of the English government&mdash;sent to the Pope a copy
of the treaty which has been made between his father and
John in 1209, and requested that Honorius would by his
apostolic authority either confirm or annull it, as should seem
to him best. Honorius committed the decision of the matter
to Pandulf,<a name="Anchor_597" id="Anchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 597.">[597]</a> who was then on his way to England<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>Nov.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>. Pandulf,
after studying the text of the document,<a name="Anchor_598" id="Anchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 598.">[598]</a> <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1219</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> appointed a day for
a formal discussion of the questions at issue between the
parties, in his presence, at Norham on 2nd August, 1219.<a name="Anchor_599" id="Anchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 599.">[599]</a>
Alexander appeared in person; Henry was represented by a
proctor. The discussion ended in an agreement that on the
morrow of All Souls’ day another meeting should take place
before the Legate, wheresoever he might be, “to treat
concerning peace between the two Kings; and if peace cannot
then be attained, the cause shall be proceeded with according
to law.” Where this second meeting was held we know not,
nor by what means peace was “then attained”; but it
certainly was attained: “We are coming back at once” wrote
Pandulf, in the triumph of his successful mediation, to Peter
des Roches, “for, as Stephen de Segrave” (King Henry’s
proctor) “and Master Robert of Arènes may have told you by
word of mouth, our lord the King’s matters with the King of
Scotland are by God’s grace now happily settled.”<a name="Anchor_600" id="Anchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 600.">[600]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1219</div>

<p>What these “matters” were is nowhere stated. Later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
indications, however, point to a probability that all these
obscure proceedings resulted in a ratification of the treaty as
a whole, but with a modification of one article. William the
Lion had given the wardship and marriage of his two daughters,
Margaret and Isabel, to John, with fifteen thousand marks
which were, seemingly, intended to form their dowries. The
only copy of the treaty of Norham which we possess says
nothing more on the subject than this; but from other sources
we have reason to infer the existence in the original text of
a further stipulation, that the elder girl, Margaret, was to
become the wife of John’s heir, or if the boy should not live
long enough, of the next heir, the baby Richard; and also of a
formal surrender, made on the express condition of this
marriage, of all the Scot King’s claims upon Northumberland,
Cumberland, and Westmorland.<a name="Anchor_601" id="Anchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 601.">[601]</a> When this treaty was made,
in August 1209, Henry’s age was one year and ten months;
Richard’s was seven months. Margaret of Scotland was fourteen
years old at the least.<a name="Anchor_602" id="Anchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 602.">[602]</a> By 1218 Margaret’s brother and Henry’s
guardians must all alike have begun to feel that this clause as it
stood was doomed to prove impracticable. Henry’s great-grandfather
Geoffrey of Anjou had, indeed, at the age of fifteen,
married a woman ten years older than himself; and the difference
of age between Henry <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr> and Eleanor was probably not
much less. But Eleanor was Duchess of Aquitaine, and
Geoffrey’s bride was heiress of Normandy and England; while
Margaret could bring to her husband nothing beyond her share
of the fifteen thousand marks. The guardians of the reigning
King of England might fairly expect to have no difficulty in
finding for him in due time a matrimonial alliance fraught
with greater advantages, personal and political, than were
offered by a marriage under these circumstances with a sister
of his own vassal; and Henry himself, when old enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
decide, was almost certain to repudiate the engagement so
lightly made for him by his father. On the other hand, unless
some steps were taken in anticipation of this contingency,
Scotland might find that she had given England fifteen
thousand marks for nothing: the non-fulfilment of this
unlucky clause would invalidate the whole treaty, and might
lead to a rupture between the two countries, which both
parties desired to avoid. After Henry’s final coming of age
in 1227, we are told, he had to give the King of Scots two
hundred pounds worth of land for the quit-claim of the three
northern counties, “because the former agreements<a name="Anchor_603" id="Anchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 603.">[603]</a> were not
observed”&mdash;that is, because Henry had not married
Margaret.<a name="Anchor_604" id="Anchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 604.">[604]</a> This compensation for his failure to marry her
may have been agreed upon between the two Kings when she
was betrothed to Hubert de Burgh in 1220 or 1221. Possibly,
however, and even more probably, it may have been settled in
Pandulf’s presence in November, 1219.</p>

<p>From Scotland the Legate turned to Wales. Throughout
the winter of 1219–1220 he was in the west of England,
negotiating with Llywelyn for the settlement of a dispute
between the Welsh prince and Hugh de Mortimer about
certain manors on the Welsh border.<a name="Anchor_605" id="Anchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 605.">[605]</a> On 2nd December
Llywelyn was invited, or summoned, to meet the Legate at
Worcester to discuss the matter on 7th January, 1220.<a name="Anchor_606" id="Anchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 606.">[606]</a> The
King’s letter, however, contained a summons to answer
complaints as well as to make them; and it may have been
for this reason that Llywelyn was unwilling to obey it. At
his request Pandulf postponed the meeting till the octave of
Candlemas.<a name="Anchor_607" id="Anchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 607.">[607]</a> <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1220</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> It seems to have had a successful result
thus far, that Llywelyn was induced to refrain from open
hostilities throughout the spring. On Rogation Monday,
4 May, he met the King, the Legate, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Bishop of Winchester, and the Justiciar, in
conference at Shrewsbury,<a name="Anchor_608" id="Anchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 608.">[608]</a> and gave what was understood on
the English side as a promise that he would surrender the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
lands in dispute between himself and Hugh de Mortimer.<a name="Anchor_609" id="Anchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 609.">[609]</a>
An attempt was also made to check the perennial strife
between the men of the Welsh prince and those of the
English Earl in Pembroke, by a truce on the understanding
that the Marshal and the other Marcher lords “should be
restored to their rights” before 1st August.<a name="Anchor_610" id="Anchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 610.">[610]</a> On the strength
of these promises David, Llywelyn’s eldest son by Joan, was
formally taken under the King’s protection, and the subject
princes of Wales were bidden in the King’s name to be loyal
to both Llywelyn and David.<a name="Anchor_611" id="Anchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 611.">[611]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1220</div>

<p>From Shrewsbury King, Legate, and council hastened to
London for an important public ceremony. Early in April
the Legate and the Primate had received letters from the
Pope ordering that Henry “should be a second time raised to
the office of king, with due solemnity, according to the custom
of the realm; because his first coronation, on account of the
disturbed condition of his realm, had been performed less
solemnly than was right and fitting, and in another place than
that which the usage of the kingdom required.” This, of
course, meant that the boy was to be re-crowned at Westminster,
and by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Stephen was
delighted, “for he loved the King dearly on account of his
innocency.” He and Pandulf agreed that the ceremony
should take place on Whit-Sunday, 17th May, and all the
prelates and nobles were summoned to be present.<a name="Anchor_612" id="Anchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 612.">[612]</a> On the
preceding day the young King himself had another solemn
function to perform. Henry came of a family who for two
hundred years past had been known as “great builders”; he
was a lad of refined, artistic temperament, as well as of a
pious disposition; and it seems that he had already undertaken
the work which was to be the great architectural glory
of his reign, the rebuilding of the abbey church of Westminster.
On Whitsun Eve he laid the first stone of the new
Lady Chapel.<a name="Anchor_613" id="Anchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 613.">[613]</a> Next morning for the last time a king was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
crowned in the old church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edward the Confessor. In
Pandulf’s presence Henry renewed under the dictation of
Archbishop Stephen the oath which he had sworn in Gualo’s
presence at Gloucester&mdash;to protect the Church of God, and to
preserve inviolate the peace of both clergy and people and
the good laws of the realm; then the Archbishop placed in his
hands the insignia of the regal office, and set upon his head
“the crown of the most holy King Edward.” “And this
crowning of the King was done with such great peacefulness
and splendour, that the oldest men among the nobles of
England who were present asserted that they never
remembered any of his predecessors being crowned amid such
concord and tranquillity.”<a name="Anchor_614" id="Anchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 614.">[614]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1205–1208</div>

<p>Concord and tranquillity did indeed, to all outward seeming,
reign at that moment over all the dominions of the
English Crown, except the Duchy of Aquitaine. One of the
most difficult of the many difficult problems with which the
regency had to deal was the problem of how to retain Poitou
and Gascony for Henry. The heritage of his grandmother
Eleanor had descended to him almost complete. Philip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Augustus had never made any attempt to conquer Gascony;
he had seized Poitou, but the greater part of it had been regained
by John in 1214 and left in his possession by the
terms of the truce with which the war between him and Philip
had ended. John’s seneschal in Gascony at that time was
one of his chamberlains, Geoffrey de Neville<a name="Anchor_615" id="Anchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 615.">[615]</a>; another
chamberlain&mdash;Hubert de Burgh&mdash;soon became seneschal
of Poitou.<a name="Anchor_616" id="Anchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 616.">[616]</a> At the end of the year 1214 or the beginning
of the next Geoffrey de Neville was succeeded by a baron of
Saintonge, Reginald de Pons;<a name="Anchor_617" id="Anchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 617.">[617]</a> in June 1215 Hubert de
Burgh became Justiciar of England; before that year closed,
the seneschalship of Poitou was united with that of Gascony
in the hands of Reginald<a name="Anchor_618" id="Anchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 618.">[618]</a>; and thenceforth the two offices
were always granted together and became practically one.
Reginald resigned it a few months after John’s death, and
was succeeded by Archbishop William of Bordeaux.<a name="Anchor_619" id="Anchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 619.">[619]</a> A
year later William gave it up likewise, and in May 1218
Geoffrey de Neville was again sent across the sea to be
Seneschal of Poitou and Gascony.<a name="Anchor_620" id="Anchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 620.">[620]</a> Reginald and William
had resigned ostensibly for the same reason&mdash;because they
wanted to go to the Holy Land. Possibly the layman and
the prelate may both of them have been glad of an excuse
for ridding themselves of an extremely disagreeable office.
The loyalty&mdash;such as it was&mdash;of Poitou and Gascony to the
English Crown was of very recent growth; it had sprung up
since the expulsion of the Angevins from their other continental
dominions. The one persistent political aim of the
men of the South was to escape as much as possible from all
external control, no matter whence it came. Their land was
full of thriving cities and towns, each with a highly developed
administrative organization of its own, almost like so many
miniature republics; and of high-spirited, hot-tempered
barons who were perpetually quarrelling among themselves.
Moreover, towns and barons were mutually jealous of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
another; and all were alike jealous of any interference with
their respective privileges, corporate or individual, on the part
of a higher power. They were also all alike shrewd enough
to see that their chances of independence were greater under
the rule of a sovereign beyond the sea than under the direct
rule of the King of France. But they were also, all alike,
fully alive to the advantages of their position between two
rival overlords; and the possibility of some turn in Aquitanian
politics which might furnish a plea, an excuse, or a
temptation for French intervention was a danger never
absent from the minds of Henry’s counsellors in their dealings
with his transmarine dominions.</p>

<p>Besides Poitou and Gascony, the Duchy of Aquitaine
included four counties whose rulers owed homage and
obedience to the Duke as their suzerain: Angoulême, La
Marche, Limoges, and Périgord. Two of these stood, during
the early years of the thirteenth century, in relations to each
other and to their common overlord which gave them a
special importance in the politics of the Duchy. The county
of Angoulême was the heritage of Queen Isabel, John’s wife
and Henry’s mother. La Marche belonged to Hugh of
Lusignan, to whose eldest son Isabel had been betrothed in
her infancy, under whose care she had been brought up, and
from whose house her own father had literally stolen her, a
child scarce twelve years old, <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1200</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> to marry her to the King of
England. Between the houses of Lusignan and of Anjou
there was already, even at that date, a smouldering feud of
some years’ standing, which this outrage, of course, aggravated,
but which was allayed for a time in 1214<span class="sn_extra"><i>1214</i></span> by John’s promise
of little Joan, his eldest daughter by Isabel of Angoulême, as
wife to the younger Hugh in her mother’s stead. Joan was
then four years old. Her bridegroom&mdash;known simply as
“Hugh of Lusignan,” his father being Hugh, Count of La
Marche&mdash;was a young man in the prime of life,<a name="Anchor_621" id="Anchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 621.">[621]</a> gifted with
an ample share of the stirring, ambitious, acquisitive spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
which characterized his race. That race was famous alike in
legend and in history, and had reached the height of its greatness
within the lifetime of the reigning count of La Marche,
two of whose brothers had been crowned and anointed Kings.<a name="Anchor_622" id="Anchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 622.">[622]</a>
Another brother, Ralf, was in right of his wife count of Eu in
Normandy and owner of some lands in England. In 1218<span class="sn_extra"><i>1218</i></span>
the elder Hugh went to the Crusade; and thus when Geoffrey
de Neville took up the government of Poitou and Gascony,
the younger Hugh was for practical purposes count of La
Marche, and the most important personage in northern
Aquitaine. He and Joan were still only betrothed, not
married; but she was in his custody, and he was officially
treated as “brother” to King Henry; he had claims against
the English Crown respecting certain lands which John had
promised to him at his betrothal;<a name="Anchor_623" id="Anchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 623.">[623]</a> and when his uncle Ralf
of Eu died childless in the spring of 1219<span class="sn_extra"><i>1219</i></span>, he seems to have
also&mdash;no doubt on behalf of his father&mdash;laid claim to Ralf’s
estates, and taken a high-handed method of enforcing his
demand, by picking a quarrel with the King’s town of Niort.
Geoffrey de Neville tried to mediate, and promised to procure
him satisfaction for any complaint that he might have against
the town, “but,” writes Geoffrey to the King, “he answered
that he would not cease from infesting your land for us or for
anybody else.” Geoffrey had now been seneschal for a year,
and was confessedly at his wit’s end and eager to be rid of
an office in which he foresaw nothing but failure and disgrace.
“He”&mdash;that is, Hugh&mdash;“and others can see how poor we are
both in men and money.” <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>“We greatly fear that unless
speedy and effectual counsel be taken for the defence of your
land, the said Hugh and the magnates will usurp it, and it
will pass to the rule of a stranger. And we do you to wit
that unless you take strong measures for its defence, we
(Geoffrey) intend to set out for Holy Land on Midsummer
day, for we will on no account stay here to your and our own
damage and disgrace; because the said Hugh has let us
know that he will not cease from molesting you until you
give up the English lands of the count of Eu. For the love
of God, write back quickly what you wish us to do.”<a name="Anchor_624" id="Anchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 624.">[624]</a> Apparently
the answer to this letter was an order to remain at
his post; and he did so, though complaining bitterly of the impossibility
of the task laid upon him. “We have already
urged you,” he writes again, “to take some counsel for the
defence of your land of Poitou and Gascony, not so much
against the King of France as against your own barons, who
ravage your land and capture and put to ransom your townsfolk,
and behave themselves towards your men in such fashion
that it appears, and we believe, they are not well affected to
your service. We, by reason of our poverty, cannot defend
the land, nor subdue them; and they make no more account
of me than if I were a foot-boy. Wherefore we do you to
wit that unless you take other counsel without delay, you will
soon see us in England. And do not say that the King’s
land is lost through us; you are casting it away yourselves
for lack of counsel.”<a name="Anchor_625" id="Anchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 625.">[625]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1218–1219</div>

<p>At this juncture a new complication arose. Queen Isabel
had in 1218 returned to her own county of Angoulême,
received in its capital city the homage of its barons, and
taken its government into her own hands.<a name="Anchor_626" id="Anchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 626.">[626]</a> She had some
trouble at the outset with Reginald of Pons, the ex-seneschal
of Poitou, who seems to have owned some castles in the
Angoumois, and for some unexplained reason held them
against her, but was soon overcome by her superior forces.<a name="Anchor_627" id="Anchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 627.">[627]</a>
A matter of more consequence was her quarrel with
Bartholomew of Puy. In the early part of John’s reign
Bartholomew had been provost, or mayor, of the city of
Angoulême;<a name="Anchor_628" id="Anchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 628.">[628]</a> from July, 1214,<a name="Anchor_629" id="Anchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 629.">[629]</a> if not earlier, he was
seneschal of the county for John, and after John’s death for
Henry. Isabel was minded to govern for herself; rightly
or wrongly, she asserted that Bartholomew was plotting
mischief against her with some of the Poitevin barons,
especially Ralf de Lusignan the count of Eu, and also with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the King of France; she therefore deprived him of his office
and all his possessions, and made him give her his two sons
as hostages. Bartholomew, apparently, appealed to the
English government and the new seneschal of Aquitaine,
and fled for shelter to Hugh de Lusignan.<a name="Anchor_630" id="Anchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 630.">[630]</a> Just then<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>1219<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span> Hugh
and the seneschal had suddenly become friends. Geoffrey
wanted to go to England, but he was so absolutely penniless
that on reaching La Rochelle he found it impossible to
proceed any further, or even to leave the city,<a name="Anchor_631" id="Anchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 631.">[631]</a> till a loan of
a hundred and sixty marks from some local merchants was
negotiated for him by Hugh de Lusignan, who offered
himself as surety for its repayment by the English government.
This simple but timely stroke of policy made Hugh
master of the situation in Aquitaine. The letters in which
he and Geoffrey notified the transaction to King and Council
were carried to England by Bartholomew of Puy. Geoffrey
excused his acceptance of Hugh’s help on the plea that “the
trouble in your land is so great that ruin would have
followed if I had withdrawn”; Hugh modestly remarked
that “your land of Poitou was greatly disturbed, but by
God’s grace we have put it into a better state.” Both
requested that the money should be given to Bartholomew
in the presence of Ralf of Saint-Samson, who accompanied
him, and who “knew that these things were true”; and
Geoffrey added a warning&mdash;“If it be not paid, and if Sir
Hugh should be compelled to pay it for me, you will never
again find anybody who will make any loan to your order or
to you.”<a name="Anchor_632" id="Anchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 632.">[632]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1219</div>

<p>The Council perceived that the only thing to do with Sir
Hugh was to make a friend of him, if possible, by enlisting
him as a sort of unofficial colleague to the luckless seneschal.
In July Bartholomew of Puy came back, in the character of
“the King’s messenger.”<a name="Anchor_633" id="Anchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 633.">[633]</a> He seems to have brought letters
from the King and Council to Isabel, directing her to reinstate
him in his property. Almost at the same time negotiations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
were set on foot in the King’s name for a loan of a thousand
marks from the mayor and citizens of La Rochelle, and
another thousand from those of Bordeaux, “to be used and
expended by the hands of our very dear brother, Hugh of
Lusignan, in defence of our land, if it should be needful.”<a name="Anchor_634" id="Anchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 634.">[634]</a>
The possible danger against which it was thought that
defence might be needed was an attack from Louis of France.
He had been for some months past in the county of Toulouse,
fighting against the Albigensians, and some of Henry’s
subjects in Aquitaine feared that the French host, when its
work at Toulouse was done, might be used against their
sovereign and themselves.<a name="Anchor_635" id="Anchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 635.">[635]</a> These suspicions of Louis were,
however, without justification. There is not the least indication
that Louis ever thought of using, or allowing his
followers to use, the opportunity which certainly lay within
his reach for intervening at this time in the troubles of
Poitou and Gascony. The truce between France and
England, however, was now within nine months of its term;<a name="Anchor_636" id="Anchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 636.">[636]</a>
and Pandulf was growing very anxious to secure its prolongation.
In September a month’s safe-conduct was given to
some envoys from the King of France to come over and
discuss this matter.<a name="Anchor_637" id="Anchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 637.">[637]</a> In January, 1220<span class="sn_extra"><i>1220</i></span>, the Legate wrote
urgently from the west of England, where he was detained
by his negotiations with Llywelyn, to the Bishop of
Winchester and the Justiciar, begging them to send some
trusty messenger, “secretly, privately, and without delay,” to
ask Philip for a renewal of the truce; he himself drafted for
them a letter such as he deemed advisable for the envoy to
convey; and he impressed upon his colleagues the importance
of taking the matter in hand at once and insisting upon
a decisive answer from the French King.<a name="Anchor_638" id="Anchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 638.">[638]</a> Three envoys
were accordingly despatched on 26th January;<a name="Anchor_639" id="Anchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 639.">[639]</a> and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
3rd March the truce was renewed for four years from the
ensuing Easter.<a name="Anchor_640" id="Anchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 640.">[640]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1220</div>

<p>Hugh of Lusignan meanwhile <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1219</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> had thrown himself at once
into his new part, posing as the zealous protector of the
interests and loyal executor of the mandates of his little
“brother,” even in opposition to the Queen-mother, who
complained bitterly to Pandulf of the “maintenance” which
Hugh and Geoffrey de Neville, acting under instructions from
the royal Council, afforded to Bartholomew of Puy against her.<a name="Anchor_641" id="Anchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 641.">[641]</a>
In August, 1219, the countess of Eu went to England, to
claim her share of her late husband’s possessions there. As
she was a kinswoman of the Earl of Warren and a niece of
the Justiciar, a conflict between her claims and those of her
husband’s brother bade fair to stir up a good deal of trouble.<a name="Anchor_642" id="Anchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 642.">[642]</a>
By the middle of November Bartholomew of Puy seems
to have been in England again;<a name="Anchor_643" id="Anchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 643.">[643]</a> and before that time
Geoffrey de Neville was there also.<a name="Anchor_644" id="Anchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 644.">[644]</a> Geoffrey appears to
have left Poitou and Gascony under the charge of a knight
named William Gauler, who presently wrote a pathetic letter
to Hubert de Burgh, complaining that he had been left
without any revenues save those of the ports, which were only
worth fifty pounds, “for all the affairs of the Poitevins and of
Bordeaux”; moreover, his friends were telling him that the
King had ordered him to be arrested, he knew not why.
With strong protestations of loyalty William declared himself
ready to settle his accounts, “willingly and truthfully,” with
any one whom Hubert might send to Gascony as seneschal,
“whether it were the chamberlain or some other man.”
“Gascony,” he added, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>“is in a good condition up to the
present; but I greatly fear it will quickly fall back into worse
ways unless you send us good counsel and reinforcements.”<a name="Anchor_645" id="Anchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 645.">[645]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1219–1220</div>

<p>Meanwhile the towns were protesting their loyalty, and
complaining of one another, and also of the intrigues of the
French party and the lawless doings of the local barons.<a name="Anchor_646" id="Anchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 646.">[646]</a>
About this last grievance they grew more clamorous than
ever in the winter of 1219–1220. “The King’s burghers” of
La Rochelle, Niort, and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Jean d’Angély lived in perpetual
terror of the lord of Parthenay, William Larchevêque, who
with the lord of Rancon “and with the consent of others
whom we will not at present name,” persecuted them “daily
and unceasingly.” “He seizes your burghers and holds them
to ransom; he carries off their beasts of burden,” wrote the
mayor and commune of Niort. “He has put out the eyes of
the bearer of this letter, and those of two other men, without
any offence or fault of theirs, and though they were not even
on his land when he captured them. And all this evil he
does to us, so he declares, because of a hundred marks of
silver which the late King promised him, and on account of a
certain traitor whom you, Sir Hubert de Burgh, hanged when
you were our seneschal.” With one voice the towns entreated
that an efficient governor might be sent into Poitou <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1220 (<i>March</i>)</span><span class="sn_para">}</span>; and they
gave it clearly to be understood that they did not want
Geoffrey de Neville back again. “Our former governors have
been somewhat slack in their dealings with your enemies.”
“When Sir Geoffrey was here, he could not protect us; he
was not sufficient for these things, nor for other things either.
If he were here now, he would be of no use. Send us some
one more useful, more competent to manage this country, and
to provide for the welfare of its people and uphold the rights
and interests of the Crown.”<a name="Anchor_647" id="Anchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 647.">[647]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1220</div>

<p>The task of selection devolved upon Hubert de Burgh.
Pandulf, a total stranger to Aquitaine and its affairs, seems to
have declined to take any part in the matter beyond
promising to ratify Hubert’s choice, on whomsoever it might
fall.<a name="Anchor_648" id="Anchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 648.">[648]</a> Hubert was the one man then in England who knew
by experience what were the most essential qualifications for
the vacant post. Before he could find a man to his mind,
however, another sudden change occurred in the political
situation. In February or March, 1220, tidings came from
Damietta that the count of La Marche was dead;<a name="Anchor_649" id="Anchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 649.">[649]</a> and
before the middle of May Isabel of Angoulême wrote a
startling announcement to her son. “We do you to wit that
the counts of La Marche and Eu<a name="Anchor_650" id="Anchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 650.">[650]</a> being both dead, Sir Hugh
de Lusignan was left, as it were, alone and without an heir,
and his friends would not allow him to marry our daughter
on account of her tender age, but counselled him to make
such a marriage that he might speedily have an heir; and it
was proposed that he should take a wife in France; which if
he should do, all your land in Poitou and Gascony, and ours
too, would be lost. We therefore, seeing the great danger
that might arise if such a marriage should take place, and
getting no support from your counsellors, have taken the said
Hugh count of La Marche to be our lord and husband.”<a name="Anchor_651" id="Anchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 651.">[651]</a></p>

<p>This letter probably reached England shortly before the
coronation; on 22nd May Henry wrote to his step-father,
expressing his approval of the marriage.<a name="Anchor_652" id="Anchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 652.">[652]</a> At the same time
he desired Hugh to escort Joan to La Rochelle and there
deliver her to two persons (Ralph Gernon and Joldewin of Douai)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
who were charged to take care of her till they received further
orders from England.<a name="Anchor_653" id="Anchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 653.">[653]</a> A new use for the little girl’s hand
had already been devised by the royal Council; they offered
it to the young King of Scots. He was invited to meet Henry
at York on 10th June;<a name="Anchor_654" id="Anchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 654.">[654]</a> and there, on 15th June, the treaty of
marriage was arranged. Henry pledged himself to give Joan
to Alexander to be his wife, at the ensuing Michaelmas, “if
he could get her”; if he could not, his second sister, Isabel,
should be given to Alexander in her stead, within fifteen days
of the time appointed. Henry also promised that he would
either cause Alexander’s two sisters to be honourably married
in England within a year from <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Denys’s day (9th October),
or restore them to their brother within a month after that
term should have expired.<a name="Anchor_655" id="Anchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 655.">[655]</a> All thought of a marriage between
Margaret of Scotland and Henry himself had evidently been
given up by mutual consent.</p>

<p>Henry’s doubts whether he could get his eldest sister back
in time for her to be married at Michaelmas proved well
founded. Queen Isabel, when she announced her own
marriage, had assured him that she was ready to let Joan
go home as soon as he liked to send for her. At the same
time she had requested that her own dower-lands, and a sum
of three thousand five hundred marks which she alleged had
been bequeathed to her by John, should be handed over to
Hugh;<a name="Anchor_656" id="Anchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 656.">[656]</a> and it soon became apparent that she and Hugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
intended to hold Joan in pledge till this was done. The
English Council, however, were equally determined not to
give up the Queen’s dowry until that of Joan, and Joan
herself, were safely restored. On 20th June letters were
written in Henry’s name to the Pope, asking him to bid the
bishops of Saintes and Limoges compel Hugh to restore
Joan and her dowry and right the wrongs which he had done
to Henry in other matters;<a name="Anchor_657" id="Anchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 657.">[657]</a> and also to the cardinals, requesting
that they would bring their influence to bear upon the
count of La Marche, who, “regardless of his plighted vow,
having taken our mother to wife instead of our sister, now
refuses to give our sister back to us, wishing by his detention
of her to compel us to buy her back.”<a name="Anchor_658" id="Anchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 658.">[658]</a></p>

<p>The union of La Marche and Angoulême, instead of
making for the peace and safety of Aquitaine as Isabel
had pretended, was in fact no sooner accomplished than
it made matters worse than ever. Hugh openly threatened
the towns and barons who opposed him with a renewal
of hostilities, and so great was their terror that “all the
bishops, very many of the barons, and other good men of
the King’s towns of Bordeaux, Niort, La Rochelle, and
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Jean d’Angély went to him in a body at Angoulême,
desiring him that before he made war upon them he should
approach the King and the Council with reference to the
matters in dispute between him and the King.” The joint
efforts of the bishops and of the King’s envoys, who seem to
have arrived in the midst of the colloquy, wrung from Hugh
a promise to stay his hand for a while.<a name="Anchor_659" id="Anchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 659.">[659]</a> But his promises
were worthless; and the complaints of the towns continued
to pour in upon Henry’s guardians. To the town of Niort
Hugh had granted a truce of seven weeks; “but,” wrote
the mayor and commune, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>“as we had no security except his
word, we put it to Sir William Maingo the younger whether
he would keep us safe, so far as he and his men were concerned,
and maintain the truce. He wrote back to us that if we
would render to him one hundred marks a year, which King
John had promised him, he would keep us in safety; otherwise
we must guard ourselves against him and his men; and
he has already done us some injury. We likewise sent
letters to Sir William Larchevêque, that he might certify us
whether he would keep the truce or not. And he wrote back
that he would not keep the truce, but would do us all the evil
and damage that he could; and he is oppressing us so that
we dare not get our harvest in; and he sets traps for us daily,
and so do many others”&mdash;Hugh’s own men-at-arms among
the number.<a name="Anchor_660" id="Anchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 660.">[660]</a> “When the truce was begun between us and
the count of La Marche,” they write again, “the count by
one of his knights declared us deprived of all rights within
his fiefs”; he and his men were guarding all the roads so that
neither corn, nor wine, nor wood, nor any necessaries could be
got into the city, “and what is your own property he declares
to be of his fee.” Again “with tears” they implored Henry
to send them such a governor as should extricate them and
all Poitou from these perils.<a name="Anchor_661" id="Anchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 661.">[661]</a></p>

<p>The men of Bordeaux on the other hand were urgent that
Hugh should be appeased. “He has promised,” they wrote,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>“to maintain and defend the towns, from himself and his, and
all other living men, faithfully to the utmost of his power, for
your benefit and honour. And since his defence and maintenance
is, above that of all others, most useful and necessary to
your faithful men of Poitou, and molestation from him is
equally perilous and injurious to them, we entreat your royal
majesty, by every means we can, to take such counsel that a
man of such importance, such a useful defender of your land,
and so pious and humble a protector of peace and tranquillity,
may not through any other’s fault withdraw from your
service; for he has promised that so long as he lives he will,
unless you give him cause to do otherwise, remain faithfully
in your service against all men living. All these things,”
they add, “have been communicated to us by the good men
of La Rochelle.”<a name="Anchor_662" id="Anchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 662.">[662]</a> But meanwhile the good men of La
Rochelle had learned something of the value of Hugh’s fine
promises. Threatened by him with “all the harm that he
could do” to them, surrounded by enemies who persecuted
them for their loyalty, and without any protector save the
Bishop of Saintes, they again pleaded&mdash;as did also the men
of Bordeaux<a name="Anchor_663" id="Anchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 663.">[663]</a>&mdash;for the appointment of an efficient seneschal:
“Send us quickly a strong man, who will bring back the
barons to allegiance, and with their aid rout the enemies and
restore the royal authority.”<a name="Anchor_664" id="Anchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 664.">[664]</a> A rumour that the King was
about to make the viscount of Thouars seneschal of Poitou
struck panic into Niort. “God forbid it! for the viscount is
our mortal foe, and in your father’s time, with the counsel of
the King of France, he did us all the evil that he could. As
you love your land of Poitou, and us, and your own honour,
we beseech you on no account to venture on making him
seneschal; moreover, make not anyone from these parts
seneschal of Poitou. If you do, they will take your land
for their own advantage, as much as they can, as some
did in your father’s time. And we and the other faithful
men shall have to go out of your land, unless you take
diligent care and good counsel in this business. May it
therefore please your excellency to send some noble, discreet,
wise, and powerful man from the parts of England, to be your
seneschal&mdash;such a man as will know how to deal with your
affairs in Poitou, and be able to hold your land.”<a name="Anchor_665" id="Anchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 665.">[665]</a> Another
rumour&mdash;this time in England&mdash;as to the Council’s intentions
with respect to the vacant office drew forth a trenchant
protest from Earl William of Salisbury. “I am given to
understand,” he writes to Pandulf, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>“that you, together with
the King’s Council, proposed to send the count of Aumale
into Poitou to keep the land. And as it seems to me that
the count is less obedient than he should be to the King’s
commands concerning the things which he holds in England,
which are small, I doubt he would be less obedient still if he
had the seneschalship and government of Poitou which is a
great thing. And therefore I give notice to your holiness
that you will in no wise commit the custody of that land to
him by my counsel or assent.”<a name="Anchor_666" id="Anchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 666.">[666]</a></p>

<p>Oddly enough, the man finally chosen by Hubert was Philip
of Ulecote, who also had given the government some trouble
about the restitution of a castle to its rightful owner.<a name="Anchor_667" id="Anchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 667.">[667]</a> When
the choice was at last made, in August, some difficulty arose
before it could be carried into effect; the sequel suggests that
Philip’s state of health may have been the obstacle. “I never
felt any confidence,” wrote Pandulf to Hubert on 25th August,
“that Philip should go there; though you seemed mighty
certain about the matter, rambling over seas and mountains
in quest of things that are not to be had.” In a more serious
strain he warned the Justiciar that some decision must be
made at once. “You must provide for that country, which
plainly appears to be perishing through the fault of the
King’s Council. The matter has been already shamefully
delayed, and I greatly fear lest grave damage should come of
it.”<a name="Anchor_668" id="Anchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 668.">[668]</a> In the middle of September Philip of Ulecote was
formally appointed seneschal of Poitou,<a name="Anchor_669" id="Anchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 669.">[669]</a> and went across the
sea.</p>

<p>Pandulf and Peter des Roches, meanwhile, had enlisted
the services of the Dean of Poitiers, who visited England in
August, to negotiate with Hugh of La Marche for a truce.<a name="Anchor_670" id="Anchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 670.">[670]</a>
A carucage “for our great needs, most urgent debts, and the
preservation of our land of Poitou” had been agreed upon in
a council at Oxford on 9th August.<a name="Anchor_671" id="Anchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 671.">[671]</a> Negotiations with the
communes of La Rochelle and Bordeaux for a loan “for the
safe keeping of Poitou and Gascony” were begun in
September.<a name="Anchor_672" id="Anchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 672.">[672]</a> These two towns, with Niort and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Jean
d’Angély, had now resolved upon sending representatives to
England to lay their complaints before the Council; the
Preceptor of the Temple, Gerard Brochard, at their request<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
undertook to accompany these envoys, and begged the Council
to give him and them an audience in London in the week
after Michaelmas, “to hear the proposals of the count of La
Marche, and of others, on all sides.” Gerard, it is clear, was
in the confidence of all parties, and he declared positively that
if the Council would listen to him, the damsel Joan would be
restored to them in honour and freedom; “she would have
been delivered to me,” he said, “if I would have stood surety
that the King would do to the count what he ought.”<a name="Anchor_673" id="Anchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 673.">[673]</a>
Probably Gerard received in London, and thence transmitted
to Hugh, a formal assurance that Henry would “do what he
ought”&mdash;in other words, surrender his mother’s dowry. At
the same time the Pope took up the matter; and a letter from
him, on 20th September, threatening that if Hugh did not
within fifteen days after its receipt deliver Joan, together with
the city of Saintes and the Isle of Oléron (which had been
pledged to him by John as security for her dowry) to Henry’s
appointed representatives, he should be excommunicated and
his lands placed under interdict,<a name="Anchor_674" id="Anchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 674.">[674]</a> was followed by Hugh’s
submission, so far as the surrender of Joan herself was
concerned. In obedience to an order from England issued
on 6th October that he should either himself bring Joan to
England, or deliver her at La Rochelle to certain persons
appointed to receive her there,<a name="Anchor_675" id="Anchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 675.">[675]</a> he set out with the child; but
he fell sick at Oléron, where the Dean of Poitiers and the
new seneschal of Aquitaine, Philip of Ulecote, had been
ordered to meet him. The Dean waited for the seneschal in
vain, and at last learned that he was dead.<a name="Anchor_676" id="Anchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 676.">[676]</a> At the beginning
of November Hugh, being too ill to proceed, delivered Joan
to the commissioners&mdash;the Dean and two other envoys&mdash;who
escorted her to La Rochelle.<a name="Anchor_677" id="Anchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 677.">[677]</a> The term fixed for her
marriage was past, but at its expiration, on 13th October,
Henry and Alexander had met again at York,<a name="Anchor_678" id="Anchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 678.">[678]</a> and Alexander
had evidently consented to wait for her with patience; he
waited in fact till the following Midsummer. Her stepfather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
when he gave her up to Henry’s commissioners, assured them
of his intention to go and perform his homage for La Marche
and Angoulême as soon as his health should permit him.<a name="Anchor_679" id="Anchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 679.">[679]</a>
Thus for a few months Aquitaine was&mdash;comparatively&mdash;at
peace.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, the “concord and tranquillity” in
England had not been altogether unbroken. At first glance
the Pope’s selection of the spring of 1220 for the re-crowning
of the young King appears unaccountable. Since the ceremony
had not taken place immediately after the Primate’s return,
two years ago, it would have seemed more natural to delay it
for seventeen months longer, till the boy should have reached
the completion of his fourteenth year, the earliest age which
could, on any known principle, be reckoned as that of legal
majority. A clue to the purpose for which the matter was
hurried on may possibly be found in certain steps which were
taken immediately after the coronation. On its morrow
(18th May) “the barons who were present swore that they
would resign their castles and wardenships at the will of the
King, and would render at the Exchequer a faithful account of
their ferms; and also that if any rebel should resist the King,
and should not make satisfaction within forty days after being
excommunicated by the Legate, they would make war upon
him at the King’s bidding, that the rebel might be disinherited
without the option of a fine.”<a name="Anchor_680" id="Anchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 680.">[680]</a> A week after this, on 26 May,
the Pope wrote a letter to Pandulf. He began by expressing
his distress at the reports that reached him of his royal ward’s
extreme poverty; this, he said, was imputed chiefly to the
archbishops, bishops, and other prelates in England, some of
whom had usurped the King’s castles, manors, and other
domains, and were detaining the same <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>“on the frivolous
pretext that they wish to keep them safe till the King should
be of age; and so meanwhile the King must be a beggar,
while they run riot, against his will, on what belongs to him.”
The Pope therefore ordered that they should surrender all
such castles and lands to the King, and make restitution of all
the proceeds thence derived since the war, and bade Pandulf
enforce their compliance with penalties both spiritual and
temporal. In a second letter, written two days later, Honorius
instructed the Legate not to suffer any man, howsoever
faithful or closely attached he might be to the King, to hold
in his custody more than two of the King’s castles, on pain of
ecclesiastical censure without appeal.<a name="Anchor_681" id="Anchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 681.">[681]</a></p>

<p>From the days of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr>, if not from a yet earlier time,
the Crown had found it a hard matter to preserve its
authority over castles held in private ownership. Such
ownership was limited by the King’s right in three ways.
The owner was bound to allow his castle to be garrisoned
by the King’s own men at the King’s will; to surrender it into
the King’s hand if required; and not to make any addition
to its fortifications without the King’s licence. Against the
enforcement of these royal rights the owners of castles had
struggled, with varying success, under Henry <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr>, Richard, and
John. The civil war, and the new conditions under which
the powers of the Crown had to be exercised during the
minority of John’s successor, had intensified their jealousy of
all restriction upon their tenure of their fortresses; and a like
spirit of independence began to show itself in some of the
wardens of the King’s own castles, with regard to the
fortresses under their charge. The only important case of
this kind, until the latter part of the year 1219, was that of
Count William of Aumale. But between August, 1219, and
March, 1220, trouble began to threaten in connexion with two
royal fortresses of not less consequence than Sauvey and
Rockingham, and from two men of far greater political and
personal weight than William de Fors.</p>

<p>The combined offices of sheriff of Lincolnshire and warden
of Lincoln castle were hereditary in the family of Haye,
represented at this time by the old Dame Nicolaa, whose
capability, courage, and loyalty had never failed in the service
of John and his heir throughout the last twenty years. Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
days after the battle of Lincoln <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">24 May 1217</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> the city and county had been
committed to the boy-King’s uncle, William Longsword Earl
of Salisbury, to hold during the King’s pleasure.<a name="Anchor_682" id="Anchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 682.">[682]</a> This grant
was probably made with the double purpose of rewarding
Longsword for his share in the victory, and relieving Nicolaa
of a burden which she had, nearly two years before, declared
to be too great for her.<a name="Anchor_683" id="Anchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 683.">[683]</a> Five months later, however, when
peace was made, the old lady asked to be reinstated in her
hereditary functions. Her request was granted, and on
31st October the Earl was bidden to deliver the castle to her
and give her seisin of the sheriffdom without delay; but the
latter half of this order seems not to have been enforced;<a name="Anchor_684" id="Anchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 684.">[684]</a>
and at the beginning of December the county “with all its
appurtenances” was again committed to William to hold
during the King’s pleasure.<a name="Anchor_685" id="Anchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 685.">[685]</a> This time, however, the castle
did not go with the shrievalty; for from March, 1218<span class="sn_extra"><i>1218</i></span>, onwards
we find the former once more, with the full sanction of the
Crown, under the charge of its veteran castellan, Nicolaa.<a name="Anchor_686" id="Anchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 686.">[686]</a>
No one seems to have ventured on molesting her till three
months after the death of the old Earl Marshal. Then, on
23rd August, 1219<span class="sn_extra"><i>1219</i></span>, “the sheriff of Lincoln”&mdash;no doubt the
Earl of Salisbury’s deputy&mdash;had to be sharply told that he
was to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>“maintain, protect, and defend the lands, goods, and
men of our trusty and well-beloved Nicolaa de Haye within
his bailiwick, to cause her no molestation, injury or damage,
nor to meddle in any way with her debts to the Crown, or in
any matters concerning her, till he received orders to do so”;
and next day “all the knights and good men” of the shire
were informed that the King had assigned Falkes de Bréauté
(who was sheriff of two shires contiguous to Lincolnshire,
those of Northampton and Rutland) to Dame Nicolaa as her
assistant in the defence of Lincoln castle, “and that they
should all efficaciously counsel and assist Falkes in the King’s
business which Falkes would explain to them, for the
preservation of the peace of the realm.”<a name="Anchor_687" id="Anchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 687.">[687]</a> It seems that
Falkes, with three of his knights (and no doubt some
attendant men-at-arms), at once took up his abode in the
castle and made it his headquarters for the next nine months.<a name="Anchor_688" id="Anchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 688.">[688]</a>
From a temporary absence in January, 1220<span class="sn_extra"><i>1220</i></span>, when he went to
meet the King at Northampton, he was recalled by an urgent
message from Nicolaa; and a letter from Falkes himself to
Hubert de Burgh makes it perfectly clear that the danger
against which he was required to protect her was a persistent
endeavour of the Earl of Salisbury, as sheriff of the county, to
enter the castle. “But,” wrote Falkes, “God helping me,
with the force at the Dame’s command I will take good care
that he shall not get in.”<a name="Anchor_689" id="Anchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 689.">[689]</a></p>

<p>William Longsword was a son of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr>; illegitimate,
but always acknowledged and treated as “the King’s
brother” by both Richard and John, and by Henry as “our
beloved uncle.” Richard had given him the earldom from
which he took his title, together with the hand and the great
possessions of Ela, heiress of an earlier line of Earls of
Salisbury. He had done good service to John until the
middle of 1216; then he had joined Louis, but early in 1217
he had returned to the side of little Henry, and had received
back all his forfeited estates, to which in August of the same
year were added the counties of Somerset and Devon.<a name="Anchor_690" id="Anchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 690.">[690]</a> His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
attempt to interfere with the rights of a castellan appointed
by the King to the command of a royal castle certainly
failed, and was probably abandoned without any open strife,
for there is no sign of any breach in the friendly relations
between the King and his “beloved Uncle William,” to
whom the boy seems to have been really attached. But the
mere making of such an attempt, by a man of such high
rank and so closely connected with the King, was not without
grave significance; and it coincided ominously with
another incident of graver significance still.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1220</div>

<p>The castle of Marlborough, like that of Lincoln, belonged
to the Crown. When it fell into the hands of Louis in 1216
the younger William Marshal, then in arms on Louis’s side,
claimed it as his by right. The chronicler who records this
claim mentions also a claim put forth by William to act
as Marshal for Louis in England;<a name="Anchor_691" id="Anchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 691.">[691]</a> possibly he may have
claimed the wardenship of Marlborough castle as appertaining
to the Marshalcy. The two offices may have been granted
together to his grandfather John FitzGilbert, who was certainly
Marshal under Henry I, and commandant at Marlborough
after that King’s death. In 1175–1176 a part of the fine
due to the Crown from the heirs of John FitzGilbert for
entering upon their patrimony was remitted in reimbursement
for repairs done to Marlborough castle.<a name="Anchor_692" id="Anchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 692.">[692]</a> At the
coronation of Richard John FitzGilbert’s two elder surviving
sons, John and William, shared between them the functions
of Marshal, but the hereditary character of that office was
not explicitly determined till ten years later. During the
greater part of those ten years Marlborough was not a
royal fortress; Richard had given it to his own brother
John. John’s accession as King restored it to its old
status; but no reference to its wardenship occurs in the
charter whereby John granted the Marshalcy to William
and his heirs for ever; and the great Earl never was, nor, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
far as we can see, claimed to be custodian of Marlborough
castle during John’s lifetime.<a name="Anchor_693" id="Anchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 693.">[693]</a> He certainly was so, however,
from November, 1217<span class="sn_extra"><i>1217</i></span>, until his death, and his eldest
son succeeded him in this wardenship.<a name="Anchor_694" id="Anchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 694.">[694]</a> In March, 1220<span class="sn_extra"><i>1220</i></span>,
Hubert de Burgh informed Pandulf that Marlborough castle
was being fortified&mdash;evidently without instructions from the
Crown. Pandulf bade him despatch without delay “the most
stringent letters from the King that could be drawn up,”
ordering the Marshal to stop the work at once, and strictly
forbidding all persons engaged in it, on pain of their bodies,
goods, “and even their inheritance,” to do anything towards
fortifying the castle without a special licence and order from
the King.<a name="Anchor_695" id="Anchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 695.">[695]</a> No further letters on the subject appear to be
extant; the information which Hubert had forwarded to
Pandulf may have proved to be incorrect, or the Marshal
may have given some satisfactory explanation. There is,
however, an indication elsewhere that he took upon himself
to exercise over the tenants of the castle of Marlborough
more arbitrary authority than he was entitled to assume as
custodian of that fortress for the King.<a name="Anchor_696" id="Anchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 696.">[696]</a> Moreover, there
was another matter about which trouble with him must have
been felt to be impending.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1217</div>

<p>Immediately after the younger Marshal’s return to allegiance,
in March, 1217, there had been granted to him, to hold
during the King’s pleasure, the English lands of Earl David
of Huntingdon.<a name="Anchor_697" id="Anchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 697.">[697]</a> The most important part of these lands
was the honour of Huntingdon, which the Scot Kings had
inherited from the English wife of King David of Scotland,
which William the Lion had subenfeoffed to his brother
David, and which, with the estates held by David direct
of the English Crown, had now become forfeit to its
English overlord because David and the reigning King
of Scots&mdash;his nephew Alexander&mdash;had espoused the cause of
Louis. A few months later they both submitted to Henry;
Alexander, having performed his homage in December,
was granted seisin of “the lands held of him in England
by Earl David”;<a name="Anchor_698" id="Anchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 698.">[698]</a> and in the following March orders
were issued for complete restitution to David himself of
all his English possessions.<a name="Anchor_699" id="Anchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 699.">[699]</a> He seems to have regained
them all except one castle: Fotheringay. In June, 1219<span class="sn_extra"><i>1219</i></span>, he
died, leaving an heir under age. His fief being an English
one, the right to its custody fell not to its immediate overlord
the King of Scots, but to its lord paramount the King
of England; in Henry’s name it was committed, during his
pleasure, to the charge of three knights, and an order was
issued that they should receive full seisin of “the manor of
Fotheringay” from the constable of the castle<a name="Anchor_700" id="Anchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 700.">[700]</a>&mdash;that is, the
younger Marshal (now Earl William the second of Pembroke
and Striguil), or his lieutenant there. In October the
custody of the honour was transferred to the King of Scots.<a name="Anchor_701" id="Anchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 701.">[701]</a>
But twelve months later <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1220</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> Fotheringay castle was still in the
hands of the Earl Marshal; not because either Henry or
Alexander had authorized him to retain it, but because he
was, for some reason or other, unwilling to give it up, and to
make him do so against his will was, as things then stood,
practically impossible. He was the eldest son of the
late regent. He was the most intimate friend of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Earl of Salisbury. On him, as Earl of Striguil, the
security of the Welsh March chiefly depended; as heir of
his mother, Isabel of Leinster, he was the mightiest baron of
the English March in Ireland; and as heir to the lands
which had belonged to his parents in Normandy, he could at
any moment put himself in touch with Philip of France. In
private life he seems to have been a man of high character;
and since his return to allegiance, with his friend Salisbury,
in 1217, he had, like Salisbury, acted as a valiant, useful, and
faithful adherent of the King. If the Council had shrunk
from taking extreme measures against Aumale, much less
could they proceed to extremities with Salisbury and the
Marshal. Yet the example set by these two men was
certain to lead to further mischief unless some steps were
taken to prevent it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1220</div>

<p>The Earl Marshal was certainly, the Earl of Salisbury and
the count of Aumale were almost certainly, included among
the nobles who were present at the coronation and who
next day took the oath which has been mentioned already.<a name="Anchor_702" id="Anchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 702.">[702]</a>
The coronation, the oath, the Pope’s letters, taken all together,
suggest that in the spring of 1220 the Council had invoked
the Pope’s assistance to enhance the authority of the Crown
for the special purpose of strengthening the hands of its
guardians in an effort to deal with the whole question of the
English castles. It is, however, very difficult to guess what,
or who, can have prompted the instructions issued to the
Legate by the Pope on 26th and 28th May. The information
on which the letter of 26th May purports to be written is shown
by the records to be erroneous. No castle belonging to the
King was in the custody of either of the archbishops; only
three were in the custody of any other prelate. Those three
were Porchester, Winchester, and Southampton, held by
Peter des Roches together with the sheriffdom of the county
in which they stood. There is also no indication that either
Peter or any other prelate had ever attempted, or even been
(in England) accused or suspected of attempting, to usurp
castles or lands belonging to the Crown, or made difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
about restoring any such lands which may have been temporarily
entrusted to him for safe keeping during the war.
The second letter is equally unaccountable; for while the
enforcement of the order that no man should hold more
than two royal castles at once would have deprived Peter of
one such wardenship, it would have deprived Hubert de
Burgh of four;<a name="Anchor_703" id="Anchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 703.">[703]</a> and it would have further involved a wholesale
rearrangement not only of the wardenships, but also of
the sheriffdoms, throughout south-eastern England and also
in the Midlands, where a still greater number of royal castles
were in the hands of Falkes de Bréauté as sheriff of seven
shires. It is therefore not surprising that no use was made
of these two papal mandates. As no mention of them
occurs in the chronicles of the time, it is most probable that
they were never published; Honorius may have sent with
them private instructions authorizing Pandulf to publish or
suppress them at his own discretion. By the time they
reached England the King’s guardians were feeling their way
in more wary fashion towards the end which they had in view.</p>

<p>The King’s journey to meet Alexander of Scotland
furnished an opportunity for a royal progress through some
of the castles which lay between London and York. “The
King with his tutors,” says the Barnwell annalist, “perambulated
his realm, to know whether those whom his father
had made custodians of fortresses in England were minded
to give up those fortresses quietly to himself as their lord.”<a name="Anchor_704" id="Anchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 704.">[704]</a>
From York he went by way of Pontefract to Nottingham,
thence to Leicester, and thence to Northampton. When he
reached Rockingham, however, on 25th or 26th June,<a name="Anchor_705" id="Anchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 705.">[705]</a> the castle
gates were shut against him.<a name="Anchor_706" id="Anchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 706.">[706]</a> William of Aumale had only
ten days before been chosen as one of the King’s sureties for
the treaty with Scotland.<a name="Anchor_707" id="Anchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 707.">[707]</a> He had clearly left the court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
since then; but he was not in Rockingham castle, though he
was evidently known to be not far away, for two messengers
who were immediately despatched to him with another
royal command for the surrender of Rockingham and Sauvey
were ordered to be back at the hour of prime next morning.<a name="Anchor_708" id="Anchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 708.">[708]</a>
They seem to have returned with a request from Aumale for
a safe-conduct to the court. Meanwhile a military force
under Falkes, which had accompanied or followed the King
from Northampton to Rockingham, invested the castle,<a name="Anchor_709" id="Anchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 709.">[709]</a> with
the ready assistance of the people of the shire, who seem to
have found Aumale a very overbearing and troublesome
neighbour. On Sunday, 28th, the garrison “seeing that they
were in a strait and had not power to resist, ignominiously
went out and left free entrance to the King.”<a name="Anchor_710" id="Anchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 710.">[710]</a> A safe-conduct
until prime on that Sunday morning had been issued to
Aumale the day before;<a name="Anchor_711" id="Anchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 711.">[711]</a> he had used it, and had made
formal surrender of both Rockingham and Sauvey into the
King’s hand.<a name="Anchor_712" id="Anchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 712.">[712]</a> Next day a notice was issued in the King’s
name, stating that Count William had resigned the custody
of these two castles “of his own free will.” The King, on
his side, quit-claimed to the count the ferm received by him
from the manors and other royal demesnes, and the issues
of the Forests, attached to the castles, from the time when the
castles were given him in custody to the day on which he
resigned them, and also undertook to obtain from the Legate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
permission for the count to postpone the fulfilment of “his
vow.”<a name="Anchor_713" id="Anchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 713.">[713]</a></p>

<p>The letters patent setting forth this agreement were issued
on the joint motion of the Justiciar and the Bishop of
Winchester; Pandulf was evidently absent from the court.
There can be no doubt that Aumale’s vow here referred to
was a vow of Crusade, enjoined by Pandulf as the condition
of the count’s release from excommunication at the close of
the preceding year; and we may see in it a reason for the
extreme generosity with which the count was treated. A
government whose head was a papal Legate might make a
military demonstration, but could hardly use real force against
a man who wore the Cross. There is, moreover, some
probability that the Council, or some member of it, may have
entertained a project of letting Count William commute his
vow for an undertaking which might well be deemed a
penance quite as severe as a crusade&mdash;the seneschalship of
Poitou and Gascony. A report to that effect certainly
reached the Earl of Salisbury at some date between December,
1219, and the end of June, 1220.<a name="Anchor_714" id="Anchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 714.">[714]</a> The report may have been
false; but it is quite possible that the project may have
really existed, and by no means clear that it deserved the
scorn heaped upon it by the King’s uncle. The appointment
of William de Fors as governor of Aquitaine would be an
excellent expedient for getting him peaceably out of England;
and though troublesome there, he was not without qualifications
for the vacant post over sea. As the son of a Poitevin
father he would be quicker to understand the character of
the people, and perhaps more acceptable to some of them,
than a man of pure English blood; at the same time, his
stake in the country was too small<a name="Anchor_715" id="Anchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 715.">[715]</a> to involve him in
personal rivalry with the Aquitanian barons; while as a great
English noble he would be readily welcomed by the towns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
In the weeks between the coronation and the treaty with
Scotland the thoughts of Hubert de Burgh, “roaming over
seas and mountains” in search of a governor for Aquitaine
and at the same time haunted by the problem of the English
castles, may well have turned&mdash;or may have been turned by
Pandulf or Peter&mdash;to a possibility of ending the weary search
and winning the resignation of Aumale’s English wardenships
at one stroke; and the agreement with Aumale on
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter’s day may have been made on the basis of some
previous negotiations whose completion the march on
Rockingham was intended merely to precipitate. In the
face of Longsword’s protest, however, the project of sending
Aumale to Poitou, if ever seriously entertained, must have
been abandoned; and we may see in its abandonment the
reason why Aumale did not receive the licence which he
desired for a further postponement of his crusade. Pandulf
seems to have offered him instead the option of redeeming
his vow altogether, doubtless in the usual way, by a payment
of money; but Aumale neither paid nor went.<a name="Anchor_716" id="Anchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 716.">[716]</a></p>

<p>The 29th of the ensuing December would be the fiftieth
anniversary of the martyrdom of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas of Canterbury.
For nearly two years Archbishop Stephen had been preparing
to celebrate this jubilee by a translation of the martyr’s
relics from their lowly resting-place in the crypt of his
cathedral church to a chapel behind the high altar, where
a magnificent shrine had been made ready to contain them.
The actual anniversary was anticipated by nearly six months,
and the translation took place on 7th July, amid an immense
concourse of clergy and laity not only from all parts of
England, but from lands beyond the sea. A temporary
guest-house, on such a scale that an annalist of the time
calls it a “palace” and declares that he does “not believe its
like had been seen since the days of Solomon,” was erected
by the Archbishop for his guests, and therein rich and poor,
home-born and strangers, were entertained with a sumptuous
hospitality which the same writer likens to the banquets of
Ahasuerus.<a name="Anchor_717" id="Anchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 717.">[717]</a> “The barons of England,” also, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>“did an act of
great courtesy; for they caused proclamation to be made, a
great while before the holy body was to be removed, that no
Englishman should lodge in the town, because they wished
that those who came from other countries should find lodging
there”; they themselves took up their quarters&mdash;camping out
in the fields, it seems&mdash;outside the walls, all except the Earl
Marshal, who lodged in the city that he might take care of
the strangers and see that they came to no harm.<a name="Anchor_718" id="Anchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 718.">[718]</a> Over
twenty prelates attended, including, besides the Legate, an
Archbishop from Hungary, and the Archbishop of Reims
with three of his suffragans.<a name="Anchor_719" id="Anchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 719.">[719]</a> With graceful tact Pandulf
and Stephen concurred in giving to the French Primate the
foremost place in the religious services of the occasion; it
was he who, at their joint request, on the eve of the translation
dedicated the altar before the shrine and sang the first vespers
of the festival, and who also sang the high Mass on the great
day itself.<a name="Anchor_720" id="Anchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 720.">[720]</a> Among the lay visitors from over sea were the
widow of Cœur-de-Lion, the Count of Dreux, and many
French nobles.<a name="Anchor_721" id="Anchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 721.">[721]</a> King Henry was of course present;<a name="Anchor_722" id="Anchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 722.">[722]</a> and
all England shared in the glory of the most famous of
English saints.</p>

<p>Early in August a great council was held at Oxford, mainly,
it seems, for purposes of finance. A carucage of two shillings
for every plough “as it was yoked on the morrow of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> John
the Baptist last year, the fourth of our reign,” was granted to
the King by the lay magnates “for his great needs, and for
the preservation of his land of Poitou.” The collection of
this impost was entrusted in every shire to the sheriff and two
lawful men who were to be chosen “by the will and counsel
of the whole shire, in full shire-court”; and it was to be paid
into the Temple in London by 30th September.<a name="Anchor_723" id="Anchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 723.">[723]</a> The prelates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
made a similar grant on behalf of themselves and all the
clergy, secular and regular, and their tenants; these contributions
were to be paid direct to the Crown without the intervention
of the sheriffs or other lay agents. On this point
some confusion arose, and amended instructions were sent to
the sheriffs on 7th September.<a name="Anchor_724" id="Anchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 724.">[724]</a> Another difficulty thwarted
the endeavours of the sheriff of Yorkshire&mdash;Geoffrey de
Neville&mdash;to collect the “gift” in his shire; at the shire-court
held for that purpose on 14th September none of the
magnates appeared, and their bailiffs all alike declared that
“their lords knew nothing about the matter, the magnates of
those parts having never been asked for it by the King either
by word of mouth or by his letters.” Some of them suggested
that if the King himself spoke to the magnates when he came
to York (to meet the King of Scots on 13th October), the
payments would probably be made without further trouble.
Geoffrey reported the matter to the King’s Council, and asked
whether he should take forcible measures to compel payment.<a name="Anchor_725" id="Anchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 725.">[725]</a>
There is some reason to think that he did so, or tried to do
so, and that some of the Yorkshire barons retaliated at the
beginning of the next year by capturing him and keeping him
prisoner for a time.<a name="Anchor_726" id="Anchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 726.">[726]</a> Unluckily we have no record showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
how the dispute was settled; but it is clear that from
Yorkshire, at least, the carucage cannot have been paid in by
the morrow of Michaelmas. The same day was fixed for the
returns of an inquest which the sheriffs were, at the time
when the first letters about the carucage were issued (9th
August), ordered to make into the extent and value of the
royal demesnes and escheats in the several shires.<a name="Anchor_727" id="Anchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 727.">[727]</a> No doubt
these returns were required for fiscal purposes. The agreement
between the King and Geoffrey de Marsh, made in the same
council at Oxford,<a name="Anchor_728" id="Anchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 728.">[728]</a> was followed on 18th September by a
demand for an aid from Ireland.<a name="Anchor_729" id="Anchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 729.">[729]</a> With all this the Crown
was still deep in debt, to the Pope, to Louis, to Queen
Berengaria, to the Legate;<a name="Anchor_730" id="Anchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 730.">[730]</a> it was in fact only by means of
frequent loans from Pandulf that its current expenses could
be met at all.<a name="Anchor_731" id="Anchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 731.">[731]</a></p>

<p>Two other matters came up for settlement at the
Michaelmas session of the barons of the Exchequer and the
justices at Westminster. One of these was a complaint of the
Earl Marshal against the Prince of Wales. Llywelyn’s
promise, or alleged promise, that the wrongs done by him to
the Earl and the other Marcher-lords should be righted by
Lammas Day<a name="Anchor_732" id="Anchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 732.">[732]</a> was not fulfilled; indeed, the truce made in
May on the strength of that promise seems to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
broken as soon as Llywelyn returned from Shrewsbury to
his own country. He asserted that the men of Pembroke
refused to confirm the truce, called in help from Ireland
against him, and harassed the Welsh to such a degree that at
last he was obliged to bid his nephews and his other followers
withdraw from the borders of Pembrokeshire to a safer place.<a name="Anchor_733" id="Anchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 733.">[733]</a>
The Marshal, on the other hand, declared that the Welsh
Prince “in no wise kept the terms of the peace, but brought
the King’s dignity into contempt, spurning his own promises
and acting quite contrary to them.” The Marshal complained
to the King at Oxford, and was promised satisfaction&mdash;so far
as the King could give it&mdash;in London on the morrow of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Michael.<a name="Anchor_734" id="Anchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 734.">[734]</a> On 21st August the sheriffs of Gloucester,
Hereford, and Worcestershire were ordered to be in readiness
to help, with all the forces of those three shires, whichever of
the King’s liegemen they should find to be the object of an
attack for which Llywelyn was reported to be collecting his
forces.<a name="Anchor_735" id="Anchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 735.">[735]</a> It was, however, not against any place on the border,
but against “the Flemings of Rhos and Pembroke” that
Llywelyn, with “most of the princes of Wales” and “a vast
army,” marched on 29th August. He took by assault and
burned the castles of Arberth and Gwys, burned the town of
Haverford “to the castle-gate”; “and thus he went round
Rhos and Deugleddyv in five days, making vast slaughter of
the people of the country. And after making a truce with
the Flemings until the kalends of May, he returned back happy
and joyful.”<a name="Anchor_736" id="Anchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 736.">[736]</a> The terms of this truce were humiliating in
the extreme; the men of Pembroke promised that they would
give Llywelyn a hundred pounds, that they would not restore
the castles which he had destroyed, and that they would give
him a portion of the Earl’s land “to keep as on behalf of the
King.” All these conditions, however, were to be subject to
confirmation by the King. They seem to have been in fact
extorted by means of a false representation on Llywelyn’s part
that his invasion of the Earl’s lands was sanctioned and supported
by the authority of the English Crown.<a name="Anchor_737" id="Anchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 737.">[737]</a> For the honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
of that authority itself, no less than for his own sake, the
Marshal besought the King and his Council to quash the truce,
disavow all complicity in Llywelyn’s raid, and give judgement
in favour of himself, at the time previously appointed,
on his former complaint against the Welsh prince.<a name="Anchor_738" id="Anchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 738.">[738]</a> The
judgement was probably given accordingly; on 5th October
the Welsh invasion of Pembroke was disavowed by the King,
the truce quashed,<a name="Anchor_739" id="Anchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 739.">[739]</a> compensation claimed from Llywelyn for
the Marshal and the other Marcher-barons whom he had
injured,<a name="Anchor_740" id="Anchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 740.">[740]</a> and two commissioners despatched to receive from
him a surrender of all lands occupied by the Welsh in
England and the Marches.<a name="Anchor_741" id="Anchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 741.">[741]</a></p>

<p>In all probability, it was as a kind of security for the settlement
of this Welsh business that the Earl Marshal had
persisted throughout the summer in retaining Fotheringay
castle. An urgent order for its surrender was despatched
three days <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">18 June</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> after the treaty of York was signed;<a name="Anchor_742" id="Anchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 742.">[742]</a> the restitution
of this castle, and of Earl David’s other lands, being one of the
conditions of the treaty. On 11th September the Marshal
was by another royal letter reminded of this fact, and
commanded, on his fealty and his oath to the King, to hand
over the said castle and lands to Alexander without further
excuse or delay, “knowing for certain that unless you give it
up, all our business about the marriage will come to nought.”<a name="Anchor_743" id="Anchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 743.">[743]</a>
Hereupon the Marshal wrote to the Justiciar that he would
do his best to promote the advantage of the King and his
sister, and would on the morrow of Michaelmas answer fully
to the Council concerning Fotheringay, and be ready to obey
them “in all things that he could and ought”; at the same
time declaring his intention to abstain for the present from
vengeance on Llywelyn, rather than disobey the King and the
Legate, “unless indeed,” he added significantly, “it should&mdash;which
I do not believe&mdash;afterwards appear that they will not
grant me justice.”<a name="Anchor_744" id="Anchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 744.">[744]</a> The Welsh quarrel being decided in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
favour, he seems to have consented to give up Fotheringay not
indeed to King Alexander, but to King Henry; for it was to a
representative of the latter that he was bidden to deliver it on
11th October.<a name="Anchor_745" id="Anchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 745.">[745]</a> This was two days before the Kings met
again at York.<a name="Anchor_746" id="Anchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 746.">[746]</a> It was probably agreed there that
Fotheringay should, to facilitate its recovery from the
Marshal, be temporarily placed in Henry’s hand and entrusted
to the English Justiciar.<a name="Anchor_747" id="Anchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 747.">[747]</a> Hubert’s marriage with Alexander’s
sister Margaret may have been already arranged, and Alexander
may have contemplated giving him the custody of the honour
of Huntingdon during the minority of its heir.<a name="Anchor_748" id="Anchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 748.">[748]</a> It seems,
however, that not till 23rd or 24th November did the Marshal
actually deliver up the castle, to one Gregory de la Tour, who
was appointed to have the charge of it,<a name="Anchor_749" id="Anchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 749.">[749]</a> probably as
deputy for Hubert. The troubles of the English government
in connexion with it were not ended even then.</p>

<p>The count of Aumale had surrendered his wardenships; but
he still kept possession of one castle which by a legal decision
of the King’s Court, given four years before, belonged to
another man. This was Bytham, in Lincolnshire. Originally
a part of the honour of Holderness, it had been alienated by the
first husband of Aumale’s mother, and was thus at the time of
the war the property of one William de Coleville. This man
joined the rebels, and thereupon his lands were occupied by
the count of Aumale, to whom they were no doubt granted
by John. On Coleville’s return to allegiance in 1217<span class="sn_extra"><i>1217</i></span> orders
were issued for their restoration; but two successive letters
from the King to the count failed to procure this,<a name="Anchor_750" id="Anchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 750.">[750]</a> and in
November Aumale was summoned to answer before the King’s
Court at Westminster for his retention of Bytham.<a name="Anchor_751" id="Anchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 751.">[751]</a> The
Court adjudged the castle to Coleville;<a name="Anchor_752" id="Anchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 752.">[752]</a> but somehow
Aumale retained possession of it, seemingly without further
question, possibly therefore by private agreement with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
rival owner.<a name="Anchor_753" id="Anchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 753.">[753]</a> In the night of 26th December, 1220, Aumale
slipped away without leave from the Christmas gathering of
the court at Oxford, and rode to Bytham.<a name="Anchor_754" id="Anchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 754.">[754]</a> There he
collected in a few days a force of armed men, and began to
harry the neighbouring townships, carrying off the corn
to store it in Bytham castle, and capturing men whom he
imprisoned there and tortured till they purchased their
release. While the terrified country-folk sought safety for
their goods in the churchyards and their persons in the
churches,<a name="Anchor_755" id="Anchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 755.">[755]</a> he attempted to surprise the castles of Newark,
Sleaford, and Kimbolton, but at each of them met with an
ignominious repulse.<a name="Anchor_756" id="Anchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 756.">[756]</a> It seems that the King’s Council on
hearing of these outrages summoned Aumale to answer for
them at Westminster, and that he made a pretence of
intending to obey, and received a safe-conduct for that purpose.<a name="Anchor_757" id="Anchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 757.">[757]</a>
Instead of doing so, however, he suddenly marched to
Fotheringay. The responsible warden of Fotheringay at that
moment appears to have been Hubert de Burgh.<a name="Anchor_758" id="Anchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 758.">[758]</a> But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Hubert was in London with the King, and Fotheringay was
garrisoned by a mere handful of knights and men-at-arms.
Aumale and his followers set fire to the gate, scaled the walls,
slew two of the garrison, and captured the rest.<a name="Anchor_759" id="Anchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 759.">[759]</a> The count
then returned to Bytham and continued his depredations.<a name="Anchor_760" id="Anchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 760.">[760]</a>
One writer of the time says that he even had the impudence
to send letters to the mayors of the cities of England, telling
them that he had granted to all merchants “his peace, and
licence to go freely to and fro between his castles for the
exercise of their business,” “as if he alone were master in the
realm.”<a name="Anchor_761" id="Anchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 761.">[761]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1221</div>

<p>The seizure of Fotheringay probably became known in
London late on January 22nd, or very early next morning.
It seems that a great meeting of the royal Council had been
convened for the 25th, but was held immediately on receipt of
the tidings, in <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul’s Cathedral.<a name="Anchor_762" id="Anchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 762.">[762]</a> William of Aumale and
all his helpers and abettors were excommunicated by the
Legate, the Archbishop of York, and seven (or ten) bishops
of the southern province (its primate was at Rome), the Earls
of Chester and Salisbury likewise holding lighted candles
which they threw on the floor when the sentence was pronounced.<a name="Anchor_763" id="Anchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 763.">[763]</a>
The grounds of the excommunication were fourfold:
first, Aumale’s refusal either to fulfill or to redeem his
vow of crusade; second, his contempt of the “judgement of
the realm” which had adjudged Bytham to William de
Coleville; third, his seizure of “a castle of his lord the King”
(Fotheringay) by treachery and without previous “defiance”;<a name="Anchor_764" id="Anchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 764.">[764]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
fourth, his neglect to make amends according to the
Legate’s command for the plunderings which had brought upon
him his former excommunication.<a name="Anchor_765" id="Anchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 765.">[765]</a> A summons was issued
immediately to such of the barons as were not present,
bidding them meet the King at Northampton with all the
forces they could bring.<a name="Anchor_766" id="Anchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 766.">[766]</a> Some of the magnates made an
attempt to persuade Aumale into submission, but without
success.<a name="Anchor_767" id="Anchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 767.">[767]</a> When the King and the host reached Northampton,
they found that the count had left Bytham secretly, and was
making for his own castle of Skipton in Craven.<a name="Anchor_768" id="Anchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 768.">[768]</a> On this
orders were issued that Skipton and two other of his strongholds,
Cockermouth and Skipsey, should be “besieged and
utterly destroyed” by the forces of the shires in which they
respectively stood&mdash;Lancashire, Westmorland and Yorkshire.<a name="Anchor_769" id="Anchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 769.">[769]</a>
Meanwhile the garrison left by Aumale at Fotheringay
“hastened to consult their own safety” by going to join their
friends at Bytham;<a name="Anchor_770" id="Anchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 770.">[770]</a> and when, on 3rd February, the royal
forces, with a formidable siege train brought from Nottingham
by Philip Marc,<a name="Anchor_771" id="Anchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 771.">[771]</a> marched upon Fotheringay, they found that
castle deserted. Falkes was entrusted with its safe keeping,<a name="Anchor_772" id="Anchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 772.">[772]</a>
and the rest of the host moved on to Bytham. There a
summons to surrender was rejected by the garrison, who were
forthwith excommunicated again.<a name="Anchor_773" id="Anchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 773.">[773]</a> Then the place was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
assaulted, with such effect that it was almost in ruin when on
8th February its defenders surrendered at discretion.<a name="Anchor_774" id="Anchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 774.">[774]</a> What
remained of it was immediately burnt to the ground, with all
its contents.<a name="Anchor_775" id="Anchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 775.">[775]</a> Aumale was presently found by the Archbishop
of York and the northern barons, in sanctuary at
Fountains Abbey, whence they brought him to the King
under a promise that if he could not obtain mercy from his
sovereign, they would take him back to Fountains in safety.<a name="Anchor_776" id="Anchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 776.">[776]</a>
At the Legate’s desire, “peace was made between him and
the King, forasmuch as he had served the King and his father
faithfully and efficiently in the war”; and his knights and
men-at-arms were all set free without punishment or ransom.
Roger of Wendover grumbles at this clemency of the King,
“who,” he says, “set a very bad precedent for others to rebel
against him in like manner, trusting to be similarly treated.”<a name="Anchor_777" id="Anchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 777.">[777]</a>
Pandulf was probably a better judge than Roger of the
respective claims and advantages of mercy and severity in
such a case. His mild policy certainly proved successful so
far as Aumale himself was concerned. The count managed,
indeed, to stave off the fulfilment of his crusading vow for
more than twenty years longer; but in all those years he
seems never, save for one brief moment in 1223, to have given
any trouble to the government.<a name="Anchor_778" id="Anchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 778.">[778]</a></p>

<p>The next step taken by the King’s guardians towards the
recovery of control over the royal castles was a weighty one.
They “urged” Earl William the Marshal to surrender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Marlborough<a name="Anchor_779" id="Anchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 779.">[779]</a> and Luggershall; “a thing which”&mdash;as the
king himself explained in a letter written some three years
later&mdash;“was most expedient for us, that thereby the other
magnates should be more easily induced to resign likewise
the castles of ours which they held.”<a name="Anchor_780" id="Anchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 780.">[780]</a> To conciliate the
Marshal himself was, however, at that moment especially, a
matter of almost greater consequence than to get possession
of the castles. No other man in England had as much power
to strengthen or weaken the hands of the government as he;
and that power was on the increase. In June, 1220, he had
ceded to his brother Richard his rights to the Norman lands
of their father. Richard, having no lands in England, could
do what the Earl could not&mdash;enter into his Norman heritage,
by doing homage for it to Philip Augustus; and he did so
without delay.<a name="Anchor_781" id="Anchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 781.">[781]</a> Thus the family was brought into close
connexion with the interests of France. The Marshal’s wife,
a half-sister of the Count of Aumale, had now been dead
some years, and he was contemplating a marriage with a
sister of Earl Robert de Bruce. In view of the relative
geographical positions of Bruce’s earldom on the Scottish
border and the Marshal’s lands in Ireland, the prospect of
this alliance filled the English King’s Council with alarm; the
more so as they believed that “there were other magnates in
England who by malicious confederations were striving to
turn away his heart from” the King.<a name="Anchor_782" id="Anchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 782.">[782]</a> They therefore offered
him a bride of higher rank&mdash;the youngest sister of the King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>The Justiciar and the Marshal pledged their faith to each
other that this marriage should take place, if the King and the
magnates of the realm would give their consent, which the
Legate and Hubert promised to do their utmost to obtain.
The Marshal then surrendered the two castles, delivering
them into the hands of the Legate as their custodian, on a
promise that they should be restored to him if the contract
were not fulfilled within a certain time.<a name="Anchor_783" id="Anchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 783.">[783]</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to guess who can have been the magnates
suspected of “trying to turn the Marshal’s heart away” from
his young sovereign. There were, however, rumours of a
treasonable plot about this time. The Justiciar’s uneasiness
was shown in an order, issued early in March, that no person,
armed or unarmed, should be allowed to land at or sail from
Bristol, Exeter, or any of the Cinque Ports unless he had a
special warrant from the King.<a name="Anchor_784" id="Anchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 784.">[784]</a> While the court was
assembled at Winchester for Whitsuntide, Peter de Maulay,
the sheriff of Dorset and Somerset and warden of the royal
castles of Corfe and Sherborne, was arrested on a charge of
treason brought against him by one Richard Muscegros.<a name="Anchor_785" id="Anchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 785.">[785]</a>
Engelard de Cigogné was arrested and imprisoned at the
same time, also on suspicion of treason.<a name="Anchor_786" id="Anchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 786.">[786]</a> On the Friday in
the same week (4th June) Peter de Maulay delivered to the
King, by the hands of the Justiciar, the Earls of Salisbury and
Pembroke, and William Brewer, the royal castle of Corfe,
with the King’s cousin Eleanor, the Scot King’s sister Isabel,
and the jewels, crossbows, and other property which King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
John had committed to Peter to keep in the castle.<a name="Anchor_787" id="Anchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 787.">[787]</a> Thereupon
he seems to have been released,<a name="Anchor_788" id="Anchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 788.">[788]</a> on an undertaking to
stand his trial before the King’s Court at a later time. The
charge against him, whatever may have been its origin, was
evidently already recognized as unfounded; he was left in
possession of his sheriffdoms, and of another royal castle,
Sherborne,<a name="Anchor_789" id="Anchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 789.">[789]</a> and no further proceedings were taken in his case
till November. Then, at a great council in London, he was,
according to one account, tried and acquitted;<a name="Anchor_790" id="Anchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 790.">[790]</a> according to
another, “he put himself on the King’s mercy, and was
reconciled with him, his accusers thinking better of the
challenge which they had brought against him.”<a name="Anchor_791" id="Anchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 791.">[791]</a> His
sheriffdoms were transferred to other hands,<a name="Anchor_792" id="Anchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 792.">[792]</a> but he was
publicly acknowledged by the King as “trusty and well-beloved”;<a name="Anchor_793" id="Anchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 793.">[793]</a>
and Sherborne castle was left in his keeping till
the end of January, 1222.<a name="Anchor_794" id="Anchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 794.">[794]</a> The charge against Engelard de
Cigogné was evidently found to be as baseless as that against
Peter; Engelard was released on giving hostages for the
surrender of Windsor castle whenever the King should require
it,<a name="Anchor_795" id="Anchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 795.">[795]</a> but it was not required till more than two years later, and
then only in consequence of a papal order for the surrender
of all the royal castles of England; and meanwhile, four
months after his arrest, he was employed by King and Council
on important political and financial business in Poitou.<a name="Anchor_796" id="Anchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 796.">[796]</a>
Peter de Maulay is said to have sworn to John that he would
not give up the castles committed to his charge till Henry
should be of age.<a name="Anchor_797" id="Anchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 797.">[797]</a> Possibly Engelard may have been in the
same case, and the “treason” of both may have consisted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
a refusal, grounded upon this previous oath, to obey some
demand made by the Justiciar for the surrender of Corfe and
Windsor on the strength of the oath taken at the coronation
in 1220. There is indeed no evidence of such a demand
having been made; but it appears somewhat significant that
both Peter and Engelard were released, and the charges
against them practically withdrawn, as soon as the one
prisoner had surrendered Corfe and the other given security
for the surrender of Windsor on demand.</p>

<p>The marriage of Alexander and Joan was now fixed to
take place at York in the middle of June.<a name="Anchor_798" id="Anchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 798.">[798]</a> The court
therefore moved northward, by way of Oxford, Northampton,
and Nottingham; and in each of these castles, it is said, the
garrison was reinforced, or a part of it replaced, by some
knights of the King’s own household.<a name="Anchor_799" id="Anchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 799.">[799]</a> On 19th June<a name="Anchor_800" id="Anchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 800.">[800]</a>
Alexander and Joan were married by Archbishop Walter.<a name="Anchor_801" id="Anchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 801.">[801]</a>
A month later<span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">19 July</span><span class="sn_para">}</span>, at Westminster, in presence of the bishops of
Winchester, London, and Salisbury, Pandulf publicly
resigned his legation.<a name="Anchor_802" id="Anchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 802.">[802]</a> Archbishop Stephen, who had been
at Rome ever since the previous autumn,<a name="Anchor_803" id="Anchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 803.">[803]</a> was now coming
home,<a name="Anchor_804" id="Anchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 804.">[804]</a> bringing with him a grant from the Pope of some
important privileges, one of which was that during Stephen’s
own lifetime no resident legate should again be appointed in
England.<a name="Anchor_805" id="Anchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 805.">[805]</a> In all likelihood Pandulf had asked to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
released from the double burden which he had now borne
for more than two years.<a name="Anchor_806" id="Anchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 806.">[806]</a> By resigning his legation he also
laid down his regency; for it was in virtue of his authority
as the Pope’s representative that he had been chosen to
succeed the Earl Marshal as regent. Neither the Pope nor
the magnates took any steps to provide a successor to
Pandulf in this latter office; and thus the first English
regency suddenly came to an end.</p>

Professor Powicke, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 228, says positively that this was so, citing as his
authority “<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Rotuli Clausarum">Rot. Claus.</abbr> passim</i></cite>.” So far as I can see, however, these Rolls contain
no actual proof that the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">R. camerarius</span>” who figures in them together with
the treasurer and another chamberlain whose initial is “F.” is Ralf de Neville.
The identification seems to be an inference from Pandulf’s injunctions about
“paying nothing out.”

This is clear from the tone of Pandulf’s letters. See especially the letter of
12th May&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rogamus autem et monemus prudentiam tuam ut <em>verbum secretum

Pandulf issues his orders “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>legationis</em> qua fungimur auctoritate</span>” (<cite><i><a href="#Footnote_546a" title="Go to citation in Footnote 546.">ib.</a></i></cite>),
because in his case the secular authority of the regent was included in and
covered by the legatine authority. He had been made regent just because he
was the Pope’s Legate.

In <cite>the Patent Roll of 15 John (1213–1214), <i>Pat. Rolls <abbr title="John">Joh.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 107</cite>, it is stated
that “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vicesimo secundo die Decembris liberatum fuit sigillum apud Windlesoram
Radulfo de Nevill, sub domino Wintoniensi episcopo deferendum</span>.” From this it
has by some writers been inferred that Peter was Chancellor for a short time in
1213–1214. But Walter de Gray, who had been Chancellor ever since 2nd October,
1205 (<cite id="Footnote_577a"><i>Close Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 53</cite>), appears in that capacity on 10th October, 1213,
and again on 12th January, 1214 (<cite><i><a href="#Footnote_577a" title="Go to citation in Footnote 577.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 156&nbsp;b, 160</cite>), and the title of chancellor
is nowhere given to Peter. It seems therefore that Ralf was made keeper of the
seal “under the Bishop of Winchester” as a mere temporary arrangement, necessitated
by the fact that the Chancellor (Walter de Gray) was going to Flanders on
business for the King; <cite><i><a href="#Footnote_577a" title="Go to citation in Footnote 577.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 156&nbsp;b</cite>. See also <cite>Powicke, “Chancery,” <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 226, 227</cite>.

The notices of little Henry during his father’s lifetime are unluckily very few.
We know that about August, 1215, he and his mother were sent for safety to the
royal castle of Corfe (<cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire des Ducs de Normandie">Hist. Ducs</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 152</cite>), and that at the time of his father’s
death he was in the castle of Devizes, under the care of a valiant man-at-arms,
Ralf of Saint-Samson (see above, <a href="#Page_2" title="Go to page 2."><abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 2, 3</a>). These temporary removals of the boy
from Peter’s custody were, however, certainly not due to any withdrawal of John’s
confidence from Peter, whose name follows that of Gualo in the list of executors
of the will made by John on his death-bed.

<cite>Roger of Wendover, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 63</cite>, says the crowning was at Canterbury, but he is

derived from a common source, and based upon a mistake. There is superabundant
documentary evidence that Hubert had been justiciar uninterruptedly
ever since 1215; if he had not been reappointed at Henry’s accession, there could
be no reason and no occasion for him to be reappointed now; and his own words
in 1239, as given in the <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Responsiones</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 64</cite>, distinctly imply that nothing of the

The Barnwell annalist’s account of this affair (<cite><abbr title="Walter of Coventry">W. Cov.</abbr>, <i><a href="#Footnote_710" title="Go to citation in Footnote 710.">l.c.</a></i></cite>) suggests a
possibility that Aumale’s deputy constable at Rockingham may have been more
forward than Aumale himself to resist the King, and in fact gone beyond the
count’s orders in shutting the gates. Mr. Turner thinks the statement of <cite>Roger
of Wendover (<abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> iv, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 65)</cite> that the two castles were found “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">penitus omnia
victualium genere destituta, ita quidem quod nec etiam tres panes invenirentur in
eis</span>,” “suggests that the count had been misrepresented by the letters patent of
November, 1219, which recited that he was fortifying the castles and storing them
with corn” (<cite>Turner, <abbr title="part">pt.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 242</cite>). I cannot follow this argument; to me a
statement as to the contents of a place in June, 1220, conveys no suggestion whatever
as to the contents of that place in November, 1219.

I venture to suggest that this may be the explanation of a letter from Pandulf
to Hubert de Burgh, <i><abbr title="Royal Letters">Roy. Lett.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 130: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod actum est de vicecomite
Eboracensi, in Dei et domini regis ac nostrum pariter acceptatum esse noscitur
praejudicium et contemptum, non enim per nostram vel vestram ammonitionem
adhuc potuit liberari. Ideoque discretionem vestram monemus attentius et
hortamur quatenus ipsum secundum justitiam et legem terrae faciatis quantocius
liberari, cum teneamini hoc circa quemlibet observari facientes</span>” (?) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ita quod
honor domini regis conservetur illaesus, et vos inde possitis merito commendari</span>.”
In the printed edition this letter purports to be “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">datum apud Lincolniam, nonas
Junii</span>”; Dr. Shirley took this to be 5th June, 1220, and tentatively suggested as
“not impossible” that the outrage to which it alludes may have been an act of
vengeance perpetrated by William of Aumale, Geoffrey’s most powerful neighbour
in Yorkshire, on the erroneous suspicion that it was Geoffrey’s influence
which had “disappointed” him of Geoffrey’s former office of seneschal of Poitou.
But (1) I greatly doubt whether Aumale, or anybody else, would be “disappointed”
at not being made seneschal of Poitou. That office was neither a
pleasant nor a lucrative one, but one which most of its various holders, for many
years past, seem to have accepted with reluctance and escaped from as soon as
possible. (2) The fact that in none of the various accounts of Aumale’s misdoings&mdash;in
the chronicles, or in the royal letters patent&mdash;is there any mention
of the capture of the sheriff of Yorkshire, makes it appear very improbable that he
was concerned in the matter. Had he been so, or even suspected of being so,
his enemies would surely have made the most of such a charge to add to the
indictment which, as we shall see, was brought against him early next year.
(3) Dr. Shirley cites as a reference showing this letter to have been written in
1220 “<i>inter alia</i>, <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Rotuli Clausarum">Rot. Claus.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 419&nbsp;b</cite>”; but I can see there nothing
which bears on the subject. It seems to me possible that the word printed <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Junii</em>
may have been originally a contracted form of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Januarii</em>; that the true date of the
letter may be 5th January, 1221; and that its true connexion may be not with
Aumale but with the dispute about the carucage. I can find in the Rolls nothing
to prove or to indicate whether Geoffrey de Neville was or was not at liberty
either <i><abbr title="circa">c.</abbr></i> 5th June, 1220, or <i><abbr title="circa">c.</abbr></i> 5th January, 1221. On 22nd January he was sent
with a message from the King to the count of Aumale; <cite><i>Close Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr>

“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tum quia castrum domini sui regis proditione cepit antequam ipsum

the Barnwell writer’s statement that Fotheringay was in the custody of
Hubert. Strictly speaking, Fotheringay was never “a castle of his (Aumale’s)
lord the King,” <i>i.e.</i>, King Henry; it was a castle of the Earl of Huntingdon’s,
and held of the King of Scots; Henry had only the right to its custody during
the minority of the heir, and he had committed it to Alexander as custodian. If,
however, Alexander had (as he very likely may have done) placed it temporarily
in Henry’s hand, to be garrisoned by Henry’s men under Henry’s justiciar, the
Dunstable writer’s words would be far more intelligible than if they were applied
to it when in the keeping of the Earl of Chester, who we know was, at some date
before&mdash;unluckily there is nothing to prove how long before&mdash;12th March, 1221,
appointed custodian of the honour of Huntingdon not by Henry, but, with Henry’s
sanction, by Alexander; see above, <a href="#Footnote_748" title="Go to footnote 748.">footnote 748</a>.

<cite>The Continuator of Florence of Worcester, <abbr title="anno">a.</abbr> 1221, (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 173)</cite>, says that
Pandulf “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a legationis officio revocatur</span>.” This phrase need not exclude a
voluntary resignation; he may have been recalled at his own request. No papal
letters on the subject are extant; it is probable that Pandulf, like Gualo, asked
permission to lay down an office which seems never to have been much to his
taste; and it is even possible that he may have made his request through Stephen.

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Pandulf resigned his offices in England the King
was within three months of his fourteenth birthday.
Whether his minority was to terminate then, or how much
longer it should continue, was still undecided. It seems to
have been considered as terminable at any time after
October 1st, 1221, at the discretion of the Pope; and this
may have been the reason why no provision was made for
a continuance, in the hands of any person or persons whatever,
of the special authority in temporal matters which had
been vested in the Legate. The Council which had carried
on the administration of affairs under him was, so far as we
can see, simply left to carry it on without him.</p>

<p>The government thus constituted had no reason to
anticipate any immediate difficulties. The realm was at
peace within its own borders, and at peace with its neighbour
lands, Scotland and France. The Welsh princes were
as usual not only quarrelling among themselves but also
dragging the barons of the English border into their
quarrels; but a new agreement among the princes, and a
truce between Llywelyn on the one part, and the Marshal
and Reginald de Breuse on the other, had just been patched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
up by Pandulf at Shrewsbury.<a name="Anchor_807" id="Anchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 807.">[807]</a> The alliance with Scotland
was further cemented by another marriage before the end of
the year; in fulfilment of Henry’s promise that the Scot
King’s sisters should be provided with husbands in England,
Margaret&mdash;once the destined bride of Henry himself&mdash;became
the fourth wife of his Justiciar, Hubert de Burgh.<a name="Anchor_808" id="Anchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 808.">[808]</a>
In Ireland, Geoffrey de Marsh had so misused his day of
grace, by neglecting to fulfill the promises which he had
made to the King a year before, that his removal could no
longer be avoided; and just before Pandulf’s resignation
letters in the King’s name were sent to the native princes of
Ireland and the barons of the March, setting forth
Geoffrey’s misdeeds and proclaiming that in consequence of
them, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>“we, being justly provoked thereto that we should
suffer him to rule our land of Ireland no more, do by the
common counsel and assent of ourself and of the magnates
and faithful men of England ordain that Henry Archbishop
of Dublin shall have the custody and care of that land till
we shall determine otherwise.”<a name="Anchor_809" id="Anchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 809.">[809]</a> The letters patent appointing
the Archbishop Justiciar in Ireland had in fact been
issued a fortnight before;<a name="Anchor_810" id="Anchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 810.">[810]</a> but a formal surrender of the
office by Geoffrey was necessary before they could take
effect. This surrender Geoffrey made on October 25th.<a name="Anchor_811" id="Anchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 811.">[811]</a></p>

<p>A new seneschal of Poitou and Gascony, Hugh of
Vivonne, had been appointed on 4th January.<a name="Anchor_812" id="Anchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 812.">[812]</a> He undertook
the office with evident reluctance and forebodings&mdash;or
hopes&mdash;of a speedy return;<a name="Anchor_813" id="Anchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 813.">[813]</a> and at the end of nine months
he seems, like many another before him, to have found
himself unequal to the difficulties of the situation. A Gascon
noble of greater fame and a more highly trained and widely
practised diplomatist were sent both at once to relieve and
supersede him. The first was Savaric de Mauléon; the
second was Pandulf. On 6th October the prelates, barons,
and people of Poitou and Gascony were informed that the King
had committed those two counties and their appurtenances
to Savaric,<a name="Anchor_814" id="Anchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 814.">[814]</a> and also that he was sending Pandulf&mdash;now
described as “bishop elect of Norwich, and chamberlain to
the Pope”&mdash;into Poitou “for great and difficult matters,” in
which the inhabitants of the land were exhorted to give the
ex-Legate every assistance in their power.<a name="Anchor_815" id="Anchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 815.">[815]</a> Pandulf seems
to have set out on his mission immediately, and in the full
expectation that it would be one of considerable duration;
on 12th October he had letters of protection for a year from
All Saints’ day.<a name="Anchor_816" id="Anchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 816.">[816]</a> The primary purpose of that mission was,
seemingly, to negotiate with Hugh of La Marche. Hugh
and Isabel were still clamouring for Isabel’s Aquitanian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
dower-lands; the English government was determined not
to restore these till Hugh had performed his homage and
surrendered the lands given him by John in pledge for the
dowry of Joan; which lands Hugh was equally determined
to keep until his wife’s claims were satisfied. By the end of
September Hugh’s aggressions had become so intolerable
that the English Council retaliated by seizing into the King’s
hand all the lands held in England by Hugh and Isabel as
part of Isabel’s dower.<a name="Anchor_817" id="Anchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 817.">[817]</a> But to retaliate in Aquitaine itself
was not so easy. One great difficulty was, as usual, the
want of money. The mayor and commune of London stood
surety for the King to the mayor and commune of La
Rochelle for the repayment of two loans, which the last-named
city was requested to make “for the safe-keeping and
defence of our land of Poitou,” the one of a thousand marks
to Pandulf, the other of five hundred marks to Engelard de
Cigogné and Emeric de Sacy, who were despatched at the
same time as Pandulf, also on business “touching our land
of Poitou.”<a name="Anchor_818" id="Anchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 818.">[818]</a> On 1st November letters were addressed to
the mayors and good men of Cognac, Saintes, Angoulême,
and Oléron, bidding them withdraw from all further allegiance
to the count of La Marche, and recognize no commands
save those of the King’s seneschal of Poitou.<a name="Anchor_819" id="Anchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 819.">[819]</a> No name was
given to the seneschal in this letter. The acting seneschal
was still Hugh of Vivonne; Savaric, it seems, was even more
reluctant than Hugh had been to undertake the office&mdash;he
was probably more fully aware of its difficulty&mdash;and made
his acceptance of it dependent on the fulfilment of certain
conditions, whether political, military, or financial, there is
nothing to show. The English Council, in fact, at the very
moment when they were thus writing brave words to the
Aquitanian towns, knew that their only hope of dealing
successfully with either Hugh de Lusignan or Savaric lay in
the diplomacy of Pandulf; and on 2nd November they
commissioned the ex-Legate <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>“to procure in whatever way he
could the making of a prolonged truce between the King
and the count of La Marche, and, having obtained this, to
persuade and exhort Savaric de Mauléon to hasten into the
presence of the King, who would (God willing) do what was
right concerning his (Savaric’s) requests. If, however, the
elect of Norwich could not make a truce with the Count,
then let him devote his care and diligence to the carrying on
of the King’s business according to what had been determined
in the King’s presence; and let him deliver the care and
custody of those parts to Savaric, inducing him thereto as
best he could, and causing him to be efficiently provided with
money for the defence of the land, according to the form
which had been given to him.”<a name="Anchor_820" id="Anchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 820.">[820]</a> The Council’s trust in the
dexterity of Pandulf was not misplaced. That he succeeded
in making with La Marche a truce which lasted through the
winter and was succeeded in the spring by some more definite
agreement, may be gathered from the fact that nothing more
is heard of either Hugh or Isabel till April, 1222<span class="sn_extra"><i>1222</i></span>, and then
the Queen’s English dower-lands were restored to her.<a name="Anchor_821" id="Anchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 821.">[821]</a> He
was equally successful in “inducing” Savaric de Mauléon to
undertake the seneschalship of Aquitaine; an office for which
Savaric was, probably, by far the fittest man to whom it had
ever been given, or offered, since the recall of Hubert de
Burgh.</p>

<p>Pandulf’s mission to Poitou has a significance beyond its
actual results. It indicates how large and disinterested was
the view taken by him and by Honorius of what the papal
overlordship of England and guardianship of its young King
should involve. The foreign churchman who for two years
and a half had been, alike in right and in fact, supreme head
of the government in England had no sooner laid down his
office there than he&mdash;of course with the sanction of the Pope,
whose chamberlain he still remained&mdash;placed himself at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
disposal of the English ministers of State, so lately his
subordinates, and accepted from them a diplomatic commission
which could bring no advantage of any kind either
to himself or to the Roman See, solely for the purpose of
helping them and their young sovereign out of a difficulty.
On the other hand, the fact that these ministers, when no
longer under any necessity of admitting him to a share in
their counsels, were so ready to make use of his help and
placed in him so much confidence as is implied in the
latitude of the powers with which they entrusted him on this
occasion, is a strong testimony to the estimation in which
their previous relations with him had led them to hold his
character, his abilities, and his devotion to the welfare of
King and kingdom. As under William the Marshal, so under
Pandulf, we cannot tell whether the inner working of the
royal Council had been really as harmonious as its outward
action appears, nor how much of its harmony, inward or
outward, was due to the regent. Some indications of rivalry
between certain of the King’s councillors seem to be discernible
before the close of Pandulf’s rule; but so far as we
can see, no open breach among them showed itself till some
two years and a half after his controlling hand was removed.</p>

<p>It is difficult to define precisely the composition, during the
minority of Henry <abbr title="the Third">III</abbr>, of the body known as the King’s
Council. That body included, besides the Primate of all
England, the justices, and the great officers of State&mdash;justiciar,
chancellor, treasurer,&mdash;certain persons who were called to be
members of it on personal rather than official grounds, such
as Bishop Peter of Winchester, Philip d’Aubigné, the Earl of
Chester, and the King’s uncle, Earl William of Salisbury.
Since the spring of 1219 the most onerous and important part
of the work of government had been shared, under Pandulf,
between Hubert de Burgh and Peter des Roches; Hubert, as
Justiciar, naturally taking the more prominent part. Among
our materials for the history of the time we find no suggestion
anywhere that they were other than true yoke-fellows, till
at Whitsuntide, 1221, there occurred the mysterious affair of
Peter de Maulay.<a name="Anchor_822" id="Anchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 822.">[822]</a> The only two chroniclers who record De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Maulay’s arrest say nothing more about its grounds than that
he was “accused of treason.” Falkes de Bréauté, four years
later, asserted that Peter de Maulay after dining at court was
called into the King’s chamber as if for some private discourse,
and there denounced as a traitor who had made a compact
with the King of France to deliver into his hands the Lady
Eleanor of Brittany, Henry’s cousin, who had been a State
prisoner in Corfe castle for many years; moreover, according
to Falkes, a greater personage than the castellan of Corfe was
involved in the accusation; it was asserted that a ship to
convey the lady over sea had been made ready by the Bishop
of Winchester, who at the time of the arrest was absent from
England on a pilgrimage to Compostella, and that the bishop
was really gone not to pay his devotions to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> James, but to
talk over the plot with Philip Augustus. Falkes declared that
the only real plotters in the case were the Justiciar and his
“accomplices,” who for their own private ends had planned
the arrest of Peter de Maulay in the absence of Peter des
Roches, and invented this story against both; and he adds
that they overwhelmed De Maulay with insults, blows, and
other indignities, and loaded him with chains, before they cast
him into prison.<a name="Anchor_823" id="Anchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 823.">[823]</a> Falkes’s story is almost certainly correct
thus far, that no real plot existed; for, whatever ill-treatment
Peter de Maulay may have undergone at the time of his arrest,
his innocence was implicitly acknowledged within less than a
week, by his release as soon as he had surrendered Corfe;
and the accusation against the other Peter, if ever really made,
was clearly dropped at once and never revived. The whole
plot seems to have been a sheer fiction; but we can hardly
accept Falkes’s account of its origin. Hubert and Peter des
Roches may have been jealous of each other; and they may
have differed on some questions of policy&mdash;perhaps, amongst
other things, as to the expediency or the justice of requiring
compliance with the letter of the recent oath about the
surrender of castles, in a case where a previous oath sworn to
the late King could be pleaded against it.<a name="Anchor_824" id="Anchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 824.">[824]</a> We should,
however, require a more impartial authority than Falkes to
make us believe that Hubert’s jealousy and self-will goaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
him into an attempt to ruin his rival by a device at once so
monstrous and so clumsy as that which Falkes ascribes to him.
He is far more likely to have been duped into believing a
story invented by some unscrupulous subordinate who hoped
that it might bring promotion to himself by serving (as, no
doubt, it did serve) to the attainment of an end&mdash;the surrender
of Corfe&mdash;which he knew the Justiciar had at heart, but which
may not have commended itself to the judgement of the
Bishop of Winchester.</p>

<p>In his capacity of personal guardian, “master,” and
instructor to the young King, Bishop Peter had an assistant
in Philip d’Aubigné, a man whose valour and loyalty had
been proved both on land and sea, and who bore a high
character alike in public and private life.<a name="Anchor_825" id="Anchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 825.">[825]</a> It seems to have
been in Philip’s charge that the boy had been left while the
bishop made his pilgrimage to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> James;<a name="Anchor_826" id="Anchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 826.">[826]</a> much against the
will of Philip, who had taken the Cross at the beginning of
the year and was anxious to fulfill his vow.<a name="Anchor_827" id="Anchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 827.">[827]</a> He started as
soon as he was set free by the bishop’s return.<a name="Anchor_828" id="Anchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 828.">[828]</a> The Christian
host besieged in Damietta was known to be in great straits,
and many volunteers from Europe were eager to reinforce it.
On 19th September Bishop Peter also took the Cross;<a name="Anchor_829" id="Anchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 829.">[829]</a> Falkes
did the like about the same time; and at the close of the
year or beginning of the next they were both preparing to
set out, seemingly together, when they were stopped by the
tidings that Damietta had been surrendered.<a name="Anchor_830" id="Anchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 830.">[830]</a> The fact that
Peter contemplated such an expedition is significant. It
shows that his tutorship of the young King was at an end.
Falkes says that it was pronounced&mdash;seemingly by the other
members of the Council under Hubert’s influence&mdash;on Peter’s
return from Spain, to be at an end, on the ground that Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
was now beyond the age of pupilage.<a name="Anchor_831" id="Anchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 831.">[831]</a> The boy’s personal
emancipation from his tutor’s control, however, did not imply
any emancipation from wardship or tutelage in the legal
sense; Henry’s school-days were over, but not his minority.</p>

<p>The Christmas court was held at Winchester. On former
occasions the King, when he visited that city, seems to have
been entertained by his tutor, in the episcopal palace or
castle of Wolvesey; this time, however, the royal castle on
the hill-top was specially made ready for his abode.<a name="Anchor_832" id="Anchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 832.">[832]</a> During
the festival season <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1221–1222</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> a quarrel broke out between Earl Ranulf
of Chester on the one part and the Earl of Salisbury and the
Justiciar on the other. High words passed, and Chester
seems to have uttered some threat of violence, for we hear
that “the Earl of Salisbury and the Justiciar, the governors
of the King and kingdom, manfully prepared themselves and
their followers for resistance.” Fortunately, however, there
was now one member of the royal Council who was outside of
and above all party or personal disputes, and whose position
and character alike marked him out for the office of peacemaker.
For six years the Archbishop of Canterbury had
been reduced to a subordinate position, ecclesiastical and
political, by the presence in England of a Papal Legate; and
during the last nine months of Pandulf’s legation Stephen had
been out of the country altogether. But he had now come
back to his old place as the highest ecclesiastical authority in
the realm and the first adviser of the Crown. “Pitying the
King’s youth and lack of power,” he called his suffragans
together in council in London at Hilary-tide (1222), and in
concert with them threatened to “wield the spiritual sword
against disturbers of the realm and assailants of the King.”
This threat brought the contending parties to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>“concord and
peace.”<a name="Anchor_833" id="Anchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 833.">[833]</a> Of the subject and origin of this quarrel we know
nothing. The sole writer who mentions it tells us that “it
was said, and many persons throughout England suspected
and asserted, that the foreigners, who were more desirous of
disturbance than of peace in the realm, were trying to stir up
the Earl of Chester to give trouble to the King and disquiet
the kingdom.” Who were the particular “foreigners” thus
accused by rumour, who were the persons that spread the
rumour, and what it was that Chester really did, or threatened
to do, or was suspected of intending to do, is absolutely
unknown. So far as the evidence goes, the dispute may have
been a purely personal one, and the Archbishop’s strong
measure may have been taken for the purpose of emphasizing
the scandal and the possible danger involved in a brawl at the
King’s court between men of such high rank and importance,
rather than for that of checking any actual or even supposed
design of political disturbance or rebellion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1222</div>

<p>There was, indeed, an undercurrent of disturbance running
beneath the surface of English politics; but the disturbance,
so far as can be seen, was not, as yet, of a party character,
though it contained elements which might easily combine so
as to form a serious danger to the government. The traces
left by the war on the habits and dispositions of the classes
which had been engaged in it were far from being wiped out
even yet. The passion for tourneying which had seized upon
Englishmen after the close of their struggle with the invader
still required constant repression.<a name="Anchor_834" id="Anchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 834.">[834]</a> Moreover, the years of
confusion had brought back to England another continental
practice which had never been recognized as legal there since
Stephen’s time, the practice of private war; and so deeply
had this evil custom taken root that it seems to have been
tolerated by the King’s guardians without protest, except
when it brought a belligerent into direct collision with the
authority of the Crown. We have seen how one magnate
who was actually a member of the Council, Earl William of
Salisbury, had to be prevented by Falkes, acting under a
royal order, from forcibly ousting a rival custodian from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Lincoln castle. He avenged himself on Falkes by stirring
up against him some of the chief men of Devon and Cornwall,
one of them being the sheriff of these two counties,
Robert de Courtenay. These men banded themselves
together in March, 1221<span class="sn_extra"><i>1221</i></span>, for a combined plundering raid on
Falkes’s lands in Devonshire, “but,” wrote Falkes to the
Justiciar, “that day they received letters from the Earl of
Salisbury bidding them not move, on account of a truce
made between him and me till the quindene of Easter; to
which truce&mdash;so he told them&mdash;he had consented in order
that he might make use of the interval in Lincolnshire.”<a name="Anchor_835" id="Anchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 835.">[835]</a>
Robert de Courtenay, nevertheless, not only forcibly prevented
the shipping of corn from Falkes’s manor of
Exminster to revictual Falkes’s castle of Plympton, but
seized the corn, and flogged and imprisoned one of Falkes’s
boatmen, alleging that he had orders from the King to let no
corn go out of the harbour of Exminster. Falkes asked the
Justiciar to put a stop to this flagrant violation by a sheriff
of the rights of private property; but the tone of his letter
shews that he regarded, and expected Hubert to regard, his
struggle with Longsword as quite another matter, one in
which each of the belligerents was free to act as he thought
good, without reference to the government.<a name="Anchor_836" id="Anchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 836.">[836]</a> Another
illustration of the same evil occurs fifteen months later<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>1222<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>. The
castle of Dinas Powys, in Glamorgan, was in the hands of
the Earl Marshal, but belonged of right to Gilbert Earl of
Gloucester. The Marshal surrendered it to the King in
Gilbert’s presence in London, that it might be delivered to a
representative of the King, who in his turn should restore it
to its owner. Gilbert, instead of waiting for the completion
of this quite ordinary procedure, gathered his followers and
prepared to march upon the castle, if he did not actually lay
siege to it, in July, 1222. He was officially told that the
King was “greatly astonished,” not, it would seem, at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
taking the law into his own hands in any case, but merely at
his doing so after the transfer of the castle had been agreed
upon in the King’s presence and undertaken by the King
himself.<a name="Anchor_837" id="Anchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 837.">[837]</a> The crowning instance of lawlessness occurred a
fortnight later; and this time the offenders were neither
foreign soldiers of fortune nor English earls, but citizens of
London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1222</div>

<p>From time immemorial the fields around the Tower had
served as a holiday resort for the younger citizens, who spent
their leisure time there in wrestling and other athletic sports.
A trial of strength and skill in wrestling was arranged
to take place hard by Queen Matilda’s Hospital, between
the young men of the city and those of the suburbs, on
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> James’s day, 25th July. The citizens won the match.
Among their antagonists was the Abbot of Westminster’s
steward; and he brooded over his own defeat and that of his
comrades till he devised a way to avenge it. First, he sent
out a general notice inviting all who would to come to a
wrestling match at Westminster on the next holiday, the
feast of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter in Chains, 1st August; the prize was to be
a ram. Next, he gathered on his own side a picked band of
strong and expert wrestlers, and secretly provided them
with arms. The unsuspecting citizens came in crowds; for
a while the wrestlers seemed equally matched; suddenly the
Westminster side produced their weapons. The unarmed
Londoners were soon overcome; beaten and wounded, they
fled helter-skelter into the city. A mighty tumult arose;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
the common bell was rung, a mass-meeting was held,
schemes of vengeance were proposed. Serlo the mayor, “a
prudent and peaceable man,” advised that a complaint
should be laid before the Abbot of Westminster, and urged
that if the abbot would make a fitting compensation on
behalf of himself and his men, “all ought to be satisfied.”
The angry citizens, however, were more inclined to listen to
a certain Constantine Olaveson, “a great man in the city,”
who proposed that “all the abbot’s buildings” and his
seneschal’s house should be pulled down;<a name="Anchor_838" id="Anchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 838.">[838]</a> and next morning
an armed mob made a raid upon Westminster. Their
first intention was to attack the church; but from this “some
wise man” dissuaded them,<a name="Anchor_839" id="Anchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 839.">[839]</a> and they contented themselves
with pulling down the steward’s house and doing as much
damage as they could to his property and that of the
abbot.<a name="Anchor_840" id="Anchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 840.">[840]</a></p>

<p>The Justiciar was at this time in the west of England.<a name="Anchor_841" id="Anchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 841.">[841]</a>
It chanced, however, that Philip d’Aubigné on his return
from the East reached London a few days after the riot had
taken place; and to him the Abbot of Westminster went to
complain of the violence which he and his men had suffered.
The Londoners at once came “like bees” about the house
where Philip and the abbot were, forcibly carried off twelve
of the abbot’s horses, beat his servants, ill-treated the knights
who accompanied him, and tried to capture the abbot himself.
Philip d’Aubigné vainly endeavoured to quell the
tumult; the abbot was obliged to slip out by a back-door
and escape in a boat, in peril of his life from the stones
which the citizens flung after him.<a name="Anchor_842" id="Anchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 842.">[842]</a> On 12th or 13th August
Hubert reached London.<a name="Anchor_843" id="Anchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 843.">[843]</a> He at once called together the
mayor and aldermen and demanded the names of the ringleaders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>Constantine boldly answered for himself, asserting
that he “would give a warrant” for his action, and openly
expressing regret that he “had done less than rightly should
have been done.”<a name="Anchor_844" id="Anchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 844.">[844]</a> His boast of a warrant was disquieting; for
in the midst of the attack on Westminster he had shouted
aloud “Montjoie! Montjoie! God and our lord Louis be
our aid!” and his nephew and another citizen, Geoffrey by
name, had echoed the cry.<a name="Anchor_845" id="Anchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 845.">[845]</a> Hubert had taken the precaution
to bring with him to the Tower a band of men-at-arms
under the command of Falkes. He caused Constantine, his
nephew, and Geoffrey to be imprisoned for the night; next
morning, by his order, Falkes and his men secretly led them
out to be hanged. Constantine, when he found a rope round
his neck, offered fifteen thousand marks for his life, but in
vain; “You will stir up no more seditions in the King’s
city,” was the grim reply of Falkes.<a name="Anchor_846" id="Anchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 846.">[846]</a> Having thus got the
execution over without the citizens’ knowledge, Hubert rode
with Falkes and his soldiers through the city, seized as
many as he could of those who had been concerned in the
riot, flung them into prison, caused their hands or their feet
to be cut off, and then let them go; the rest were so terrified
by this severity that many “fled never to return.” The
hapless mayor and aldermen who had been incapable of
controlling the populace under their charge were deposed;
the city had to give hostages for its good behaviour, and was
only after long deliberation on the part of the Council
admitted to reconciliation with the Crown on payment of a
heavy fine.<a name="Anchor_847" id="Anchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 847.">[847]</a> Hubert’s drastic measures were effectual in
preventing further disturbance in the capital; but of course
“it seemed to some persons,” as a chronicler says, that
Constantine had been tried and executed “more hastily than
was fitting.”<a name="Anchor_848" id="Anchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 848.">[848]</a></p>

<p>In Aquitaine the respite from trouble won by the diplomacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
of Pandulf at the beginning of 1222 lasted through the
summer. A safe-conduct to the count of La Marche to come
and speak with the King in England was issued in June,<a name="Anchor_849" id="Anchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 849.">[849]</a> and
another in August.<a name="Anchor_850" id="Anchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 850.">[850]</a> He was evidently thought to be really
coming this time, for the Bishop of Winchester was sent across
the sea to meet and escort him;<a name="Anchor_851" id="Anchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 851.">[851]</a> but he did not come. The
sentence of excommunication issued against him two years
before had never yet been published, but it had never been
withdrawn, and the Pope seems to have now directed his
commissioners, the Bishops of Saintes and Limoges and the
Dean of Bordeaux, to publish it on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Andrew’s day. The
royal Council, however, shrank from driving Hugh to extremity;
and early in November they sent Philip of Aubigné and
the Abbot of Boxley to make another effort for a peaceful
settlement with him and Isabel, and begged the papal
commissioners to give him a further respite till the result
of these negotiations should appear.<a name="Anchor_852" id="Anchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 852.">[852]</a> Meanwhile the new
seneschal of Poitou had taken up his task with a firm and
vigorous hand; but he was hampered by the want of money,
like his predecessors, and also by the hostility of the towns,
which disliked him doubly because he was not only a baron
of considerable social and political importance in the land,
but also a man of independent character and determined
will. He stuck to his post for ten or eleven months, and
then, in September or October, went to England. A full
discussion of Aquitanian politics and administration seems to
have taken place between him and the royal Council, in the
presence of representatives from La Rochelle, Niort, <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Jean
d’Angély, Bordeaux, the viscount of Thouars, and possibly
some other towns and barons; a whole bundle of letters
patent and close, issued in consequence of these deliberations,
indicate that the Council, conscious of having at last secured
a fit man as governor, was now ready to give him all the
moral support in its power.<a name="Anchor_853" id="Anchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 853.">[853]</a> Unluckily it had little other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
support to give him. It was not till February (1223) that
Philip d’Aubigné and his fellow commissioner succeeded in
coming to any agreement with Hugh of Lusignan; and then
the result of their labours was merely another truce, to last
till 1st August.<a name="Anchor_854" id="Anchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 854.">[854]</a> Four more months passed; Hugh and
Isabel continued impenitent; so on 25th June the Pope
again threatened them with excommunication.<a name="Anchor_855" id="Anchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 855.">[855]</a> Three
weeks later, however, an event took place which led to
another change in the policy of the English government
towards the count of La Marche. This was the death, on
14th July,<a name="Anchor_856" id="Anchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 856.">[856]</a> of King Philip Augustus of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1223</div>

<p>When the treaty between Henry and Louis was made, in
September, 1217, both parties, as we have seen, bound themselves
by oath to certain conditions which are not mentioned in
the copies of that treaty which have come down to us. Henry
swore to maintain inviolate those liberties of the English
barons and people which had served as one of the pretexts
for Louis’s invasion; Louis swore that he “would do his
utmost to induce his father to restore the English King to all
his rights in the parts beyond the sea.”<a name="Anchor_857" id="Anchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 857.">[857]</a> Naturally the
English Council construed this as binding Louis, if the
restoration were not effected in his father’s lifetime, to make
it himself as soon as it was in his own power. They at once
took the matter up with a high hand. Pandulf, now Bishop
of Norwich,<a name="Anchor_858" id="Anchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 858.">[858]</a> urged the Pope to forbid that any one should
crown Louis until the promised restitution to Henry was
made.<a name="Anchor_859" id="Anchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 859.">[859]</a> The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishops of
London and Salisbury undertook the double duty of
presenting to Louis himself a formal demand for the
fulfilment of his promise, and to the Archbishop of Reims a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
protest against his coronation if the demand were not at once
satisfied.<a name="Anchor_860" id="Anchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 860.">[860]</a> Letters patent had already been issued in the
King’s name to the barons, knights, and good men of
Normandy, calling on them to return to their allegiance,
“since the opportunity is now at hand,” and promising, if they
did so, restitution to each man, according to his rights, of the
lands in England which they lost when the King’s father lost
Normandy, and such further rewards as their service should
deserve.<a name="Anchor_861" id="Anchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 861.">[861]</a> Preparations were made for collecting a fleet; all
ships coming into English ports were ordered to be seized,
emptied of their contents (which were to be stored up safely
for return to the owners), and sent to Portsmouth for the
King’s service.<a name="Anchor_862" id="Anchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 862.">[862]</a> The Forest districts of the southern counties
were bidden to send to Porchester large supplies of “hurdles
for the ships,”<a name="Anchor_863" id="Anchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 863.">[863]</a> and on 9th August the barons of the Cinque
Ports were summoned to come to Portsmouth “with the
whole service which they owe to the King, and with their
ships, with the first favourable wind, to go with the King in
his service.”<a name="Anchor_864" id="Anchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 864.">[864]</a></p>

<p>All this was a practical defiance of Louis. But to
set Louis at defiance without endeavouring to secure the
adherence, or at any rate the neutrality, of La Marche and
Angoulême would have been simply to court defeat. Two
days before the King’s truce with Hugh expired, therefore,
two of the places in dispute between Hugh and the King&mdash;the
city of Saintes and the castle of Merpins&mdash;with the town of
Cognac and the castle of Belmont, were committed to Hugh
to hold “till the King’s coming of age,” “as he held them on
the Saturday before the feast of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter in Chains” in the
preceding year; two envoys (of whom one was Geoffrey de
Neville) were despatched to take security from him <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>“for his
good and faithful service, and that he would faithfully do his
utmost to advance the King’s interest and procure his honour
till the term before mentioned”;<a name="Anchor_865" id="Anchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 865.">[865]</a> and on 4th August the
holder of the papal mandate for Hugh’s excommunication
was desired to deal with it only as the same two envoys
should direct.<a name="Anchor_866" id="Anchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 866.">[866]</a></p>

<p>Contrary winds detained Archbishop Stephen and his
fellow-ambassadors in England<a name="Anchor_867" id="Anchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 867.">[867]</a> for more than a week. When
they reached the French court, Louis was already crowned.<a name="Anchor_868" id="Anchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 868.">[868]</a>
He seems to have declined to make any immediate answer to
their demands, and adjourned the matter to the octave of
All Saints.<a name="Anchor_869" id="Anchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 869.">[869]</a> The delay was probably not unwelcome to
Henry’s counsellors, who at that moment had their hands
full with a Welsh war. The pacification at Shrewsbury in
July, 1221, seems to have been followed by an unusually long
period of comparative tranquillity on the Marches of Wales.
It was probably this condition of affairs which, when it had
lasted for sixteen months, encouraged the King’s representatives
to venture on what looks like a very bold step in the
prosecution of their schemes for asserting the royal authority
over the castles. On 11th November, 1222<span class="sn_extra"><i>1222</i></span>, the Earl Marshal
was informed by letter patent that “as the castle of Caerleon
with its appurtenances, which is in your hand, ought to be
held of us in chief, it is provided by our common council that
that castle shall be delivered into our hand; and therefore
we strictly command that you, without delay or excuse,
surrender that castle with its appurtenances to us, and
afterwards we will cause full justice to be done in our court
to you and to any others who may have aught to say about
it.”<a name="Anchor_870" id="Anchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 870.">[870]</a> For this demand it is hardly possible to conceive any
motive save one: a desire to obtain from the Marshal, by
way of example and precedent, a practical acknowledgement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
of the King’s right to take into his own hands, when he
pleased, a castle held of the Crown not merely in custody,
but in fee. If, however, this was the purpose the Council had
in view, they were ill-advised in their choice of a time for
making the demand; the Marshal, if not already in Ireland,
was on the point of setting out to spend the winter there.<a name="Anchor_871" id="Anchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 871.">[871]</a>
Possibly the King’s letter never reached him; if it did, he
had a fair excuse for not acting upon it till his return. A
second letter, written on 26th January, 1223, desired him to
surrender Caerleon before the close of Easter “because we
do not deem it advisable that you should hold it beyond that
term.”<a name="Anchor_872" id="Anchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 872.">[872]</a> But when he came back, in Passion Week, the
Welsh March was in turmoil from one end to the other, and
the Council were only too glad to make the utmost possible
use of his ready co-operation in restoring the English
supremacy in South Wales. Such a moment was clearly
inopportune for taking an important border stronghold
out of the hands of a defender at once so capable and so
loyal; and more than three years passed away before the
King ventured to renew his demand.</p>

<p>Llywelyn had taken advantage of the Marshal’s absence to
organize an attack on the English border. Early in 1223 he
besieged, took, and utterly destroyed two castles in Shropshire,
Kinnerley and Whittington.<a name="Anchor_873" id="Anchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 873.">[873]</a> The Justiciar, taking the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
with him, went at the beginning of March to Shrewsbury,
seemingly to demand or compel satisfaction from Llywelyn.
The Earl of Chester came forward as mediator, offering
himself as surety for Llywelyn’s compliance with the demand
within a given time; and the intended punitive attack on
Wales was suspended accordingly.<a name="Anchor_874" id="Anchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 874.">[874]</a> But meanwhile tidings
of Llywelyn’s outbreak had reached the Marshal in Ireland,
and in the middle of April<a name="Anchor_875" id="Anchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 875.">[875]</a> he “came up to land” somewhere
in South Wales “with a vast fleet,” carrying “a multitude of
cavalry and infantry.”<a name="Anchor_876" id="Anchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 876.">[876]</a> Hubert seems to have expected his
arrival, and sent a messenger to meet him with a request that
he would keep truce with Llywelyn for another fortnight, in
the hope that Llywelyn might yet fulfill the promise made for
him by Chester, although the time fixed for its fulfilment had
already expired.<a name="Anchor_877" id="Anchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 877.">[877]</a> The delay proved useless; and on Easter
Monday (24 April) Earl William marched upon Cardigan.
“On that day the castle was delivered to him, and on the
Wednesday following he drew to Caermarthen, and obtained
that castle also.”<a name="Anchor_878" id="Anchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 878.">[878]</a> Llywelyn, on hearing what had occurred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
sent his son Gruffudd “with a very numerous army to oppose
the Earl”; they met at Kidwelly and fought “for the greater
part of the day”; Gruffudd seems to have been worsted, and
“for lack of provision returned back to his country.”<a name="Anchor_879" id="Anchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 879.">[879]</a></p>

<p>The Marshal hereupon busied himself with the repair of
Caermarthen castle<a name="Anchor_880" id="Anchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 880.">[880]</a> till at the end of May a royal letter
patent bade him, “forasmuch as it is determined by our
Council that the castles of Caermarthen and Cardigan, which
you have taken, should be retained in our own hand,”
deliver both places to Robert de Vaux to hold during the
King’s pleasure.<a name="Anchor_881" id="Anchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 881.">[881]</a> Llywelyn had certainly proved himself
utterly undeserving of the confidence in his loyalty which
had induced the regent Earl Marshal to entrust him with
the custody of these two important strongholds; and if the
regent’s son was not actually commissioned by the Council
to recover them by force, it could at any rate have no scruples
in approving his action and reaping its fruit for the benefit of
the Crown. A day in July was next appointed for Llywelyn
and the Marshal to lay their mutual complaints before the King
and Council. The meeting took place at Ludlow, seemingly
between 6th and 10th July,<a name="Anchor_882" id="Anchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 882.">[882]</a> but the parties “could not be
reconciled.”<a name="Anchor_883" id="Anchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 883.">[883]</a> The Council had apparently not expected a
reconciliation, and had come prepared for war. On the 11th
the sheriffs of Devon and Herefordshire were bidden to take
care that no men of their respective shires should send (by
sea in the case of Devon), any supplies to, or hold any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
communication with, Llywelyn and his Welsh adherents, but
that all merchants and markets should follow the King’s army
to South Wales, “that is, to our lands of Caermarthen and
Cardigan, and to the lands of our faithful Earl William the
Marshal.”<a name="Anchor_884" id="Anchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 884.">[884]</a> An effort was made to detach the Welsh of
Deheubarth and Powys from obedience to their North-Welsh
lord; the Earls of Pembroke and Salisbury were empowered
to receive into the King’s grace “all the Welsh of South
Wales who would return to the King’s fealty and service”;<a name="Anchor_885" id="Anchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 885.">[885]</a>
the sons of Gwenwynwyn of Powys, who since Gwenwynwyn’s
death in 1216 had been living in England as wards or
prisoners of the Crown, and were now in Bridgenorth castle
under the care or in the custody of Earl Ranulf of Chester,
were brought to the King’s court at Gloucester, and all men
of the lands which had belonged to their father were invited
to “come to the sons of Gwenwynwyn and to the King’s
fealty and peace”;<a name="Anchor_886" id="Anchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 886.">[886]</a> a host of English barons and knights
marched into Wales under the command of the Marshal and
his friend Longsword.<a name="Anchor_887" id="Anchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 887.">[887]</a></p>

<p>The King and the Justiciar were recalled to London, partly,
no doubt, by the weighty news from France, and partly by
the necessity of receiving the titular King of Jerusalem, John
of Brienne, who was travelling through western Europe to
collect forces and funds for the recovery of his kingdom from
the Turks. An “aid for the Holy Land,” of three marks
from every earl, one mark from every baron, twelve pence
from every knight, and one penny from every free tiller of
the soil and every free man who had no land, but had
chattels to the value of half a mark, had been agreed upon by
the great Council of the realm in 1222,<a name="Anchor_888" id="Anchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 888.">[888]</a> but had never been
collected.<a name="Anchor_889" id="Anchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 889.">[889]</a> No Christian sovereign, however, could evade the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
duty of giving at least a personal welcome, even if he gave
nothing more, to the successor of Godfrey of Bouillon. John
seems to have crossed from France to England at the end of
August.<a name="Anchor_890" id="Anchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 890.">[890]</a> On 1st or 2nd September the English King and
Primate received him “solemnly and with great honours” at
Canterbury, and escorted him to London.<a name="Anchor_891" id="Anchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 891.">[891]</a> His visit was a
brief one, and the hospitality which he received in England
was probably amply requited by the gift of four large
sapphires&mdash;“than which we never saw finer,” says Matthew
Paris&mdash;which he, “out of his innate munificence,” on his way
back offered at the shrine of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas at Canterbury.<a name="Anchor_892" id="Anchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 892.">[892]</a></p>

<p>As soon as their royal guest was gone, King and Justiciar
hurried back to the Welsh border. The English host under
the Marshal and the Earl of Salisbury had apparently set out
with the intention of joining the Marshal’s other forces in
Pembrokeshire. It was caught by Gruffudd in one of the
intricate passes of the Welsh hills, and narrowly escaped
destruction,<a name="Anchor_893" id="Anchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 893.">[893]</a> but it seems to have cut its way through; and
the Marshal set to work to fortify “the lands which he
occupied,”&mdash;that is, doubtless, the districts of Caermarthen
and Gower&mdash;by founding new castles and repairing old
ones.<a name="Anchor_894" id="Anchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 894.">[894]</a> Llywelyn’s next diversion was to lay siege, early
in September,<a name="Anchor_895" id="Anchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 895.">[895]</a> to Reginald de Breuse’s castle of Builth, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
such a numerous force that Reginald immediately applied to
the Crown for help.<a name="Anchor_896" id="Anchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 896.">[896]</a> On 12th September the host was
summoned to meet the King “with all haste” at Gloucester,<a name="Anchor_897" id="Anchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 897.">[897]</a>
and march with him to the relief of Builth. The expedition
probably set out from Hereford on the 19th or 20th. Its
mere approach sufficed to raise the siege; on the 23rd King
and Justiciar were back at Hereford.<a name="Anchor_898" id="Anchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 898.">[898]</a></p>

<p>It was not the first time, nor was it to be the last, that the
Welsh fled before Hubert de Burgh. He now led the King
and the host from Hereford to Leominster and Shrewsbury, and
thence, on the last day of September, to Montgomery,<a name="Anchor_899" id="Anchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 899.">[899]</a> passing
through Llywelyn’s lands and driving the flocks and herds
before them as they went, to serve for the sustenance of the
troops. The castle of Montgomery, originally built by one of
the most famous of the followers of William the Conqueror,
had been more than once destroyed by the Welsh. Its site,
which had sufficed for the simple Norman keep reared by the
first Earl of Shrewsbury, was probably not suited for more
elaborate fortifications such as were used in the thirteenth
century; it served, however, to shelter the King and the
Justiciar; and some of “the wiser men of the army,” while
scouring the country around it under Hubert’s orders, found
“a place fit for building a castle whose position, everyone
thought, would be impregnable.”<a name="Anchor_900" id="Anchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 900.">[900]</a> Urgent orders were
despatched to the sheriff of Shropshire for an immediate
supply of building materials and tools, and the work was
begun at once.<a name="Anchor_901" id="Anchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 901.">[901]</a> Meanwhile Llywelyn had been excommunicated
by Archbishop Stephen. On 7th or 8th October,
at Montgomery, the Prince once more came and made
submission to King and Primate, Stephen dictating the terms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
Llywelyn swore that within a reasonable time, to be fixed by
the Archbishop, and in a fitting place, he would make
satisfaction to the King and the King’s men for all damages
done by himself and his men since the day of the taking of
Kinnerley. Six lesser Welsh chieftains swore with him;
each of the seven embodied his engagement in a charter; and
on these conditions Llywelyn was absolved.<a name="Anchor_902" id="Anchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 902.">[902]</a> Moreover, he
at once gave the King seisin of Kinnerley and Whittington,
that he might restore them to their former owners; and
Henry gave back to Llywelyn and his men seisin of all that
they had held in fee on the day of the capture of Kinnerley,
subject to a trial of counterclaims at the date fixed for
Llywelyn’s promised satisfaction<a name="Anchor_903" id="Anchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 903.">[903]</a>&mdash;that date being Candlemas,
1224.<a name="Anchor_904" id="Anchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 904.">[904]</a> This conditional restitution of course did not include
Cardigan and Caermarthen, which Llywelyn had held
merely as custodian for the Crown. On 7th November these
two castles were committed to the only man in whose
keeping they were likely to be safe&mdash;the Earl Marshal.<a name="Anchor_905" id="Anchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 905.">[905]</a></p>

<p>The time fixed by Louis for answering Henry’s demand for
the restoration of his continental heritage had now come.
On 10th October an embassy consisting of Bishops Pandulf
of Norwich and John of Ely, Philip d’Aubigné, and Richard
de Rivers, had been accredited to France to receive Louis’s
reply, and to treat with him concerning a prolongation of the
truce,<a name="Anchor_906" id="Anchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 906.">[906]</a> which would expire in April, 1224. These envoys
met with a very unfavourable reception. Louis declared that
the whole continental possessions of the Angevin house had
been by a legal judgement escheated to the French Crown;<a name="Anchor_907" id="Anchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 907.">[907]</a>
that they were therefore his by right&mdash;a right which, he
added, he was prepared to prove in his own court, if the King
of England would come and submit to its judgement; and
that moreover the agreement to which he had sworn in
England was no longer binding upon him, inasmuch as it
had been doubly broken on the English side, first by the
exaction of heavy ransoms from his partisans who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
captured at Lincoln, and secondly in that “the liberties of
the realm of England, for which the war had been waged and
which at his departure had been granted and sworn to by all,
had been so dealt with that not only those most evil laws
were brought back into use as of old, but others still more
wicked were generally established throughout the realm.”<a name="Anchor_908" id="Anchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 908.">[908]</a> He
wound up his harangue to the envoys with a distinct threat,
which he charged them to repeat to those who had sent them:
not only would he restore nothing, but he intended, when
opportunity should offer, to prosecute his claim to the
English Crown, as having been taken from John by a legal
sentence and granted by the barons of England to himself.<a name="Anchor_909" id="Anchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 909.">[909]</a>
Although the truce had still six months to run, the cry of
Constantine Olaveson must have rung ominously in the ears
of Hubert de Burgh when the French King’s complaints and
threats were repeated to him,<a name="Anchor_910" id="Anchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 910.">[910]</a> even if the return of the envoys
did not&mdash;as it most probably did&mdash;coincide with the most
alarming outbreak of baronial discontent with which the
government had had to deal since Louis left England.</p>

<p>The abolition of the regency before the King attained his
majority had inevitably resulted in giving a great increase of
power to the Justiciar. Under a sovereign of full age the
Justiciar was the King’s lieutenant; it was on him that the
supreme powers and functions of government temporarily
devolved when the King himself was absent from the realm.
It followed almost of necessity that when there ceased to be
a person specially set apart to exercise those powers and
functions for a King under age, they fell into the Justiciar’s
hands. This result of Pandulf’s resignation could not be
altogether pleasing to some, at least, of the other members of
the Council, or of the magnates outside the Council. It was
one thing, first to accept the autocracy of a ruler whom they
had unanimously chosen out of their own ranks on the score
of his transcendent personal merits, and, afterwards, to yield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
to the dictates of one who legally represented a power
acknowledged by all as superior to that of the Crown itself;
it was quite another matter to be ruled by Sir Hubert de
Burgh, and to be, moreover, confronted with a prospect of
being ruled by him till Henry’s coming of age&mdash;an event
which seemed almost as remote as ever, since, the date
originally intended for it being past, it was now seemingly
regarded as deferred till his twenty-first birthday.<a name="Anchor_911" id="Anchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 911.">[911]</a> Nominally,
of course, Hubert governed in concert with his colleagues of
the royal Council. But with the control of the executive in
his hands, and no authority capable of overriding him nearer
than Rome, he was practically master of the Council. There
were only two other members of it who could under any
circumstances have sufficient weight in themselves to act as a
check upon him. Both officially and personally Stephen de
Langton was a greater man than Hubert de Burgh. The
Archbishop of Canterbury was not only the highest ecclesiastical
authority in the land, he was also the first adviser of the
Crown; and Archbishop Stephen had long ago proved himself
a statesman of a far higher order than any other then living in
England. But Stephen had never desired to be a leader in
secular affairs; and he seems to have come home in 1221
resolved to take as little direct share in politics as possible.
His one recorded public act, for more than two years after his
return, was the holding, at Oseney in April, 1222<span class="sn_extra"><i>1222</i></span>, of a great
Church council<a name="Anchor_912" id="Anchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 912.">[912]</a> for the settlement of ecclesiastical discipline
and administration on the basis of a set of canons which he
had drawn up and on which the law of the Church of England
is grounded to this day. When he did intervene in temporal
matters, his character, even more than his office, gave to his
intervention a special importance which all parties seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
have felt and acknowledged. The Bishop of Winchester’s
position was wholly different. “Peter des Roches was as hard
as a rock,” said the monks of his cathedral chapter;<a name="Anchor_913" id="Anchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 913.">[913]</a> which
seems to imply at any rate that his conduct as a bishop did
not err on the side of neglect or laxity in matters of order
and discipline. His material benefactions to his church, and
the diligence and ability with which he managed the temporal
concerns of his see, were indisputable; and there is nothing
to indicate that he failed in any of his episcopal duties. But
Peter was ambitious of exercising his talents in a wider field
than that of diocesan administration; and his talents were
great enough to justify his ambition. After his death
Matthew Paris declared that “the whole council of the realm
of England, royal as well as ecclesiastical, had suffered an
irreparable loss” in losing him.<a name="Anchor_914" id="Anchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 914.">[914]</a> Under Pandulf he and
Hubert had worked together almost as equals; but before the
end of the year 1221 Peter found himself Hubert’s subordinate,
and found, too, that his chance of regaining at a future time
his former influence in matters of state was diminishing day
by day; for though the King’s ex-tutor retained his seat in
the Council, the King had virtually become Hubert’s pupil
instead of his.</p>

<p>There was only one possible means of altering this state of
things: to put Henry into possession, if not of full regal
powers, at least of some voice in the government of his own
realm, something like a decisive vote in his own Council. If
this were done, the Justiciar’s supremacy would become
dependent on his personal influence over the King’s mind;
and if it were done quickly, while that mind was still young
and tender and had not yet had time to take the mould of
Hubert’s political teaching, Peter might fairly hope to be
more than a match for Hubert. A suggestion that something
of this kind should be done seems to have been conveyed to
the Pope from England at some time before the middle of
April, 1223,<a name="Anchor_915" id="Anchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 915.">[915]</a> and to have been either coupled with, or accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>or followed by, a request that the Pope would issue
some instructions concerning the royal castles. When the
result of these two suggestions appeared, the onus of responsibility
for it fell upon Hubert; Hubert, however, in later days
declared that the Pope’s action in the matter had been
instigated by the Bishop of Winchester, against the interests
of Hubert himself. Meanwhile a number of the magnates
had for some time past been murmuring among themselves
against the Justiciar, resenting his haughty bearing and his
(in their opinion) high-handed judicial decisions in cases
where they were concerned, and “saying to one another that
he stirred up the King’s mind against them, and likewise that
he ruled the kingdom by unjust laws.”<a name="Anchor_916" id="Anchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 916.">[916]</a> A step which he
took at the beginning of 1223 aggravated their resentment
and their distrust. On 30th January orders were issued in the
King’s name for the sheriffs to inquire in full county court, by
a sworn jury of twelve knights, what customs and liberties
King John had in the shires before the war between him and
the barons began; to proclaim the result of the inquest in
full county court and cause it to be observed throughout the
shires; and to send a report of it to the King at Westminster
on 8th May.<a name="Anchor_917" id="Anchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 917.">[917]</a> These orders evidently caused some commotion
in the shires, for on 9th April they were significantly
modified; the King “by the advice of his faithful men”
issued other letters whereby the sheriffs were bidden not to
proclaim the royal liberties and customs ascertained by
means of the inquest or to enforce their observance, “for the
present,” and were assured that he “had no will to raise up,
or cause to be observed in the realm, any evil customs”;
these new letters also were to be read in full shire-court;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
and the date for the return of the inquest was postponed to
25th June.<a name="Anchor_918" id="Anchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 918.">[918]</a></p>

<p>By that time some important letters had probably arrived
from Rome. On 13th April the Pope had written four letters
for England: one addressed jointly to the Bishop of
Winchester, the Justiciar, and William Brewer (a well known
judge, who seems to have ranked next to Hubert on the
Bench); one to the Earl of Chester; one to the vice-chancellor,
Ralf de Neville; and one to “the earls, barons, and
other faithful subjects” of the English King. In the first of
these letters Honorius, having, as he said, heard and rejoiced
to hear that Henry, though still a boy in years, was already
so much of a man in understanding that he “ought no longer
to be debarred from disposing usefully and prudently of his
realm and its affairs,” laid his commands on the three councillors
whom he was addressing that they should henceforth
give the young King “free and unfettered disposal of his
kingdom, resign to him without any difficulty the lands and
castles of his which they held in wardenship, and procure a
like resignation of all Crown lands and castles similarly held
by other persons.”<a name="Anchor_919" id="Anchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 919.">[919]</a> The other three letters began by informing
their recipients of the orders issued in the first, as to giving
Henry the disposal of his realm; after this the letter to Earl
Ranulf conveyed to him individually the same command
with regard to his wardenships which in the first letter had
been given to its three joint addressees respecting theirs: the
third letter bade the vice-chancellor, as custodian of the royal
seal, use it henceforth according to the King’s good pleasure
and in obedience to him only, and permit no more letters to
be sealed with it save at his desire; while in the fourth letter
the earls, barons, and other liegemen were bidden “henceforth
to obey the king humbly and devotedly,” and support him
“faithfully and firmly against any who might presume to go
contrary to him,” and they were further warned that in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
event of their disobedience to these injunctions they “might
justly fear a sentence of excommunication.”<a name="Anchor_920" id="Anchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 920.">[920]</a></p>

<p>Honorius thus conferred upon his royal ward the full powers
of legal age with respect to the government of his realm in
general, and to two things in particular: the custody of royal
castles and demesne lands, and the issue of royal letters under
the great seal. This definition implied that in some other
respects Henry was still to be accounted a minor. Accordingly,
the Dunstable annalist tells us that in a great council
held in London after the return of the King and the Justiciar
from Wales, “it was provided by order of the Pope and assent
of the barons, and the provision was published, that the King
should have legal age so far as concerns the free disposition
of his castles and lands and wardenships, but not so that any
one could maintain his right through it in a court of law.”<a name="Anchor_921" id="Anchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 921.">[921]</a>
Thus Henry was still precluded from making grants in
perpetuity.<a name="Anchor_922" id="Anchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 922.">[922]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after these proceedings in London, two barons of
high standing and approved fidelity to the King, Walter de
Lacy and Ralf Musard, were called to the court, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>“and when
they got there they were not allowed to withdraw till they had
assigned to the Justiciar the castles which they held in
custody.”<a name="Anchor_923" id="Anchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 923.">[923]</a> Walter de Lacy was hereditary sheriff of Herefordshire
and constable of Hereford castle; Ralf Musard was
sheriff of Gloucestershire and constable of Gloucester castle.
For what purpose or on what grounds the assignation of
these two important border fortresses to Hubert was required,
we are not told.<a name="Anchor_924" id="Anchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 924.">[924]</a> A considerable party among the barons
regarded the proceedings against Lacy and Musard as a
flagrant act of injustice and an unwarrantable assumption of
power on the part of Hubert. The three men of chief importance
among these malcontents, Earls Ranulf of Chester,
Gilbert of Gloucester, and William of Aumale, at once resolved
to appeal to the young King in person “and show him the
malice of the Justiciar,”<a name="Anchor_925" id="Anchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 925.">[925]</a> and, no doubt, urge him to exert his
newly acquired right of independent action to put the usurper
down. Hubert, however, prevented their design by inducing
the King to go with him to the west of England&mdash;which, according
to Falkes, he did by making the lad believe that the
three Earls were plotting to seize him and hold him prisoner&mdash;and
shut himself up with him in Gloucester castle,<a name="Anchor_926" id="Anchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 926.">[926]</a> where
Hubert was now practically master. Thence he sent a message
to the Earls in the King’s name forbidding them to approach
him.<a name="Anchor_927" id="Anchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 927.">[927]</a> They, meanwhile, had been joined by Falkes de
Bréauté, Brian de Lisle, Robert de Vipont, John de Lacy,
Peter de Maulay, Philip Marc, Engelard de Cigogné, William
de Cantelupe and his son, “and many others.”<a name="Anchor_928" id="Anchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 928.">[928]</a> In their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
fury they made an attempt to surprise the Tower of London.
The attempt failed;<a name="Anchor_929" id="Anchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 929.">[929]</a> possibly its real purpose was only to
alarm the Justiciar and bring him and the King back to the
capital. On 28th November Henry and Hubert were in
London again.<a name="Anchor_930" id="Anchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 930.">[930]</a> Their return may have been hastened by the
tidings from thence; but it was probably required chiefly for
the publication of some further letters from Rome.</p>

<p>At some date prior to November, 1223, Pope Honorius was
asked, “on the King’s behalf and in his interest,” to give
orders that Bishop Peter of Winchester, Earl Ranulf of
Chester, the Justiciar, and Falkes, should be compelled to
surrender into the King’s hand the royal castles and other
bailiwicks which they held. This request can hardly have proceeded
from any of the four persons named, nor from the
royal Council as a whole. It seems, indeed, utterly unaccountable;
yet we know from the Pope himself that he received it,
that he issued the desired mandate, and that thereupon he
was asked&mdash;also “on the King’s behalf”&mdash;to quash that
mandate, lest it should give occasion to disturbance, since the
four men named were all willing to do what was required of
them in due season, and no fitter persons could be found to
replace them. The Pope, on 20th November, refused to cancel
the orders which he had given, “lest he should seem to use
lightness,” but made their execution dependent on the will of
the King.<a name="Anchor_931" id="Anchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 931.">[931]</a> The story of this correspondence is all the more
puzzling because at some date which must have been considerably
earlier than 20th November&mdash;possibly as early as
the date of the letters concerning Henry’s majority&mdash;Honorius
seems to have issued a bull by which, if its terms are correctly
represented by the writers of the time, all special mandates
for compelling individuals to surrender their wardenships were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
made superfluous. According to Roger of Wendover, certain
“messengers of the King” brought back from Rome a
bull addressed to the archbishops of England and their
suffragans, commanding that, the King being now recognized
as of an age to take the chief part in the ordering
of his realm, they should, by apostolic authority, bid all
earls, barons, knights, and other persons whatsoever having
the custody of castles, honours, and townships belonging
to the royal demesne, surrender them to the King at
once; and should force recalcitrants to submission by means
of ecclesiastical censures.<a name="Anchor_932" id="Anchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 932.">[932]</a> The reference in the Pope’s
other letters concerning Henry’s coming of age to the surrender
of Crown castles and lands seems to have been
understood, at the time when those letters were published, as
intended merely to sanction the oath taken by the barons in
May, 1220, and strengthen the hands of the young King whenever
he might wish to claim its fulfilment. But the bull to
the prelates was, by implication at least, a peremptory order
from the Pope for a general surrender of all such wardenships
at once. The existence of this bull seems to have been known
to some persons in England before the middle of November,
but the bull appears not to have been published till the
beginning of December.<a name="Anchor_933" id="Anchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 933.">[933]</a> At the council held in London on
that occasion Chester and his allies were not present; on the
King’s return they had withdrawn to Waltham. The Primate
approached them with overtures of peace, and on his assurance
of their personal safety they, in obedience to a summons in the
King’s name,<a name="Anchor_934" id="Anchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 934.">[934]</a> came before their sovereign. They unanimously
assured him that their action had been directed not against
himself, but against Hubert, who, they said, ought to be removed
from the administration of affairs, as a waster of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
King’s treasure and an oppressor of the people.<a name="Anchor_935" id="Anchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 935.">[935]</a> Hubert,
who was of course present, burst out in angry abuse of the
Bishop of Winchester, on whom he cast all the blame,
calling him a betrayer of King and kingdom, and asserting
that his ill-will was the cause of all the evils that had happened
in the time of John as well as in that of Henry. Peter retorted
that if it should cost him everything he possessed, he
would have the Justiciar dragged from power; and with this
threat he rose and left the council chamber, followed by the
barons of Chester’s party.<a name="Anchor_936" id="Anchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 936.">[936]</a> The Primate, however, succeeded
in arranging a “truce” whereby further discussion was
adjourned to the octave of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hilary.<a name="Anchor_937" id="Anchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 937.">[937]</a></p>

“on the motion of the Lord King himself.”<a name="Anchor_939" id="Anchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 939.">[939]</a> Two days later
still, a change in the testing clause of the King’s letters
marked the definite recognition of his entrance upon the
second stage of his minority. The formula which for several
years past had been almost exclusively in use&mdash;“Witness
Hubert de Burgh, my Justiciar”&mdash;disappeared, and was
replaced thenceforth by one which had hardly been seen
since the very earliest days of the young King’s reign&mdash;“Witness
myself.”<a name="Anchor_940" id="Anchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 940.">[940]</a></p>

According to <cite>the <i><abbr title="Brut y Tywysogion" lang="wlm" xml:lang="wlm">Brut</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 309</cite>, “young Rhys” (of South Wales; see
above, <a href="#Page_90" title="Go to page 90.">p. 90</a>) “became angry with the Lord Llywelyn and separated from him,
and went to William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, because Llywelyn had given
Caermarthen to Maelgwn ap Rhys, and would not give Aberteivi” (<i>i.e.</i> Cardigan)
“to him [Rhys], which fell to his share when South Wales was divided. Then
Llywelyn with his army came to Aberystwith, and obtained possession of
it.... Rhys repaired to the court of the King and complained ... and
the King assembled Llywelyn and the earls and barons of the Marches to Shrewsbury.
And in that council young Rhys and Llywelyn were reconciled, and
Llywelyn relinquished Aberteivi in his favour, as he had given Caermarthen to
Maelgwn.” On 23rd June a safe-conduct was issued to Llywelyn to come and
speak with the King “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de negociis Angliae et Walliae</span>” (<cite><i><abbr title="Patent">Pat.</abbr> Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr>
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 294</cite>). On 10th July the Legate wrote to Hubert from Shrewsbury that
Llywelyn “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et alii Wallenses et Marchiones, et Reginaldus de Brahus</span>,” had
come thither on the 7th (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">die Mercurii proxima post octavas Apostolorum Petri
et Pauli</span>,” <cite><i><abbr title="Royal Letters">Roy. Lett.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 136</cite>. Dr. Shirley dated this letter 11th July,
1220; but the “Wednesday after the octave of <abbr title="Saints">SS.</abbr> Peter and Paul” in that year
was the morrow of the translation of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas, when Pandulf cannot possibly
have been at Shrewsbury. On the corresponding day next year, 1221, he may
very well have been there; and we know from the <cite><i>Close Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 463–465</cite>,
that Hubert had been there in the preceding week, but had left on 2nd July, and
was at Windsor on the day on which Pandulf’s letter was written. The entry in
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 464 which makes Hubert appear “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">apud <abbr title="Westmonasterium">Westm.</abbr>, <abbr title="2">ii</abbr> die <abbr title="Julii">Jul.</abbr></span>,” obviously
contains a clerical error as to either place or date). On 30th April, 1222,
Llywelyn was desired to prolong his truce with the Marshal and Reginald de
Breuse until Easter “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in forma qua treugae illae captae fuerunt apud Salopesbiry
coram nobis et domino Pandulfo Norwicensi electo, tunc legato</span>” (<cite><i><abbr title="Patent">Pat.</abbr> Rolls</i>,
<abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 331, 332</cite>); whence it seems that <cite>the <i><abbr title="Brut y Tywysogion" lang="wlm" xml:lang="wlm">Brut</abbr></i></cite> is right in asserting the
King’s presence at the Shrewsbury meeting in July, 1221. The settlement,
whatever its character, was clearly the work of Pandulf, not Hubert.

an answer which must, it would seem, have put an end to all further hope of
agreement, and which I therefore think must really have been made not to the
bishops who went to him in August, but to another set of episcopal envoys who
went in October, as will be seen later.

Marshal and Llywelyn in 1223 is as follows: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eodem anno, dum Willelmus
Marescallus comes Penbroc fuit in Hibernia, Loelinus rex Walensium in manu
forti cepit duo castella praedicti Willelmi, et omnes quos in eis invenit capitibus
privari fecit, et impositis in eisdem castellis Walensibus suis, recessit. Sed cum
post dies paucos ad notitiam praedicti Marescalli res gesta pervolasset, rediit cum
festinatione in Angliam; exercitu magno congregato, castella praedicta obsedit et
cepit; et quia Loelinus prius omnes homines Marescalli quos in castellis ceperat
capitibus amputatis interfecerat, Willelmus Marescallus Walensibus talionem
reddens eorum capita detruncari fecit; et deinde ad majorem vindictam terram
Loelini hostiliter ingressus igne et ferro quaeque sibi obvia devastavit</span>” (<cite><abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr>
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 84, 85</cite>). There seems to be a double, or rather triple, confusion here. It
was not in 1223 but in 1220 that Llywelyn took two castles which belonged to
the Marshal (see above, <a href="#Page_161" title="Go to page 161.">p. 161</a>). The two castles which he took in 1223 belonged
not to the Marshal but to Fulk FitzWarine and Baldwin of Hodnet respectively
(see above, <a href="#Footnote_873" title="Go to footnote 873.">footnote 873</a>); and the two castles which the Marshal captured on his
return were not the same (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">praedicta castella</span>”) which Llywelyn had taken on
either of these two occasions, for they were Cardigan and Caermarthen, of which
Llewelyn had been legal custodian&mdash;“the person who had the custody of the
castles on the part of the King,” as <cite>the <i><abbr title="Brut y Tywysogion" lang="wlm" xml:lang="wlm">Brut</abbr></i></cite> puts it (<i><a href="#Footnote_878a" title="Go to citation in Footnote 878.">l.c.</a></i>)&mdash;ever since 1218.
The cutting off the prisoners’ heads is doubtful, especially on the side of the
Marshal, because the Welsh chronicles would have been almost certain to mention
such an act on his part if it really took place, and they give no hint of any such
thing.

This is indicated by an agreement made in 1222 with the Irish King Donell
of Thomond that the ferm due from him to the English Crown should be reduced
from a hundred and thirty to a hundred marks a year “until our coming of age,”
in consideration of a fine of two hundred marks; <cite><i><abbr title="Patent">Pat.</abbr> Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 336, 337</cite>.
In other words, Hubert, being in want of ready money for the needs of the
state, borrowed from Donell in Henry’s name two hundred marks, to be repaid
in instalments by the deduction of thirty marks a year from the ferm of Thomond
till the repayment should be completed; which would be (roughly) in 1228.

Honorius waited a long while before acting on the suggestion; for Master

March, 1222 (<cite><i><abbr title="Patent">Pat.</abbr> Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 328</cite>), and was back in England before 30th
October, when he was sent on a mission to Poitou which lasted till the very time
at which the Pope’s mandates about the majority were issued, April, 1223 (<cite><i>Close
Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 518, 541</cite>). Moreover, the letter accrediting William to the

This is evident from the non-existence of any charters or Charter Rolls of
Henry <abbr title="the Third">III</abbr> earlier than January, 1227, after which they begin immediately. See
<cite id="Footnote_922a">Powicke, <i><abbr title="English Historical Review">Eng. Hist. Rev.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="23">xxiii.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 221–223</cite>. “The clause in italics” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non

meaning of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dispositio</i>. Henry could now entrust his castles and lands, and the
property of his wards, at his own choice, but the declaration of 1218 against
permanent grants under the great seal still held good. These grants could not be
regarded in a court of law as possessed of the finality allowed to a charter”

Falkes is our only informant on this transaction; but his story, provokingly
laconic as it is, receives some countenance from the Rolls; for they show that on
15th November Lacy was, by a royal letter attested by Hubert and issued on
Hubert’s motion, ordered to deliver Hereford castle and shire to Ralf FitzNicolas
(<cite id="Footnote_924a"><i><abbr title="Patent">Pat.</abbr> Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 414</cite>), and that six weeks later the castle was in Hubert’s

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> recognition of Henry’s partial coming of age (if such
a phrase may be allowed) in December, 1223, re-introduced
into English politics and into the government of England a
factor which had been absent from them for seven years, but
which until John’s death had always been, and was again to
be for many generations, a factor of great, perhaps we should
rather say of the very greatest importance: the character and
will of the King. Thenceforth neither the Council as a body,
nor any member of it, could do any act in the King’s name
without consulting him and obtaining his sanction; nor could
they, if the King desired anything to be done which lay within
the limits of his regal powers as defined in October, 1223,
prevent him from doing it, except by persuading him to give
up his desire in deference to their advice. The circumstances
by which such abnormal authority had become connected
with the justiciarship had ceased to exist; that office was
once more reduced within its proper limits; and if Hubert
now aspired to rule England in Henry’s name, the only
way in which he could do so was by acquiring and keeping
complete personal ascendency over Henry himself. If, however,
the papal mandates which brought about this altered
condition of things had really been procured by Peter des
Roches, in the hope that when Hubert’s official importance
was thus diminished he himself might regain the foremost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
place in his old pupil’s confidence and become the chief
adviser of the Crown in Hubert’s stead, he was doomed to
wait a long time for the fulfilment of his hope. Until
Henry’s final coming of age and for many years after, so
far as the King’s policy was dictated by any one, it was dictated
by Hubert de Burgh. But even during the years which
were still to elapse before Henry attained his complete
majority, Hubert’s dictatorship was very far from absolute.
In October, 1223, the King was sixteen years old; he was
universally esteemed an intelligent, serious-minded lad; and
he had been carefully educated. In later life he did not prove
a man of lofty mental capacity or great force of character;
but he did prove to possess a will of his own, though it was
too often a fitful and a wayward will&mdash;precisely the kind of
will which may be only too easily influenced, but never
entirely directed or controlled, by another person. If Henry’s
will, at the opening of his seventeenth year and in the first
flush of his newly acquired regal independence, had been so
utterly dormant as to move only at Hubert’s impulsion, he
would indeed have been a marvellously degenerate descendant
of his Angevin and Norman ancestors. For such an
unnatural supposition there is no ground whatever. There is
every reason to believe that from December, 1223, onwards
Henry, within the limits defined in October, and with the
assistance of his Council, although relying mainly on the
advice of one member of it, actually governed as well as
reigned.</p>

<p>On the breaking up of the council in London the Earl of
Chester and his party went to Northampton to concert their
plans and muster their forces pending the expiration of the
“truce” at the octave of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hilary. They removed to Leicester
on hearing that the King was coming to hold his Christmas
court at Northampton.<a name="Anchor_941" id="Anchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 941.">[941]</a> Sumptuous preparations were made
for the festival; the majority of the magnates, as well as the
Primate and other bishops, rallied round the King, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
came together “so many earls and barons and knights in
arms that neither in the days of the King’s father, nor since,
was such a festival remembered to have been celebrated in
England.”<a name="Anchor_942" id="Anchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 942.">[942]</a> On the day after Christmas <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">26 Dec.</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> the Archbishop
and his suffragans put on their albs, lighted their candles,
and excommunicated all “disturbers of the King, the realm,
and the Church, and invaders of ecclesiastical property.”<a name="Anchor_943" id="Anchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 943.">[943]</a>
Stephen then sent a message to the discontented barons at
Leicester, bidding them come to speak with the King, and
warning them that a refusal would place them within the
scope of the excommunication just published<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>26–28 Dec.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>. Alarmed by
this threat, and conscious of the inferiority of their forces, they
obeyed the summons.<a name="Anchor_944" id="Anchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 944.">[944]</a> They were brought into the presence
of the King, the Primate, and some of the bishops,
and the Pope’s order for the restitution of the King’s property
was exhibited to them there. Then the King himself called
upon them all to obey it by immediately surrendering the
castles and other wardenships which they held for him. For a
while they hesitated whether to yield or appeal to the Pope;
but another word of warning from the Archbishop decided
them, and they agreed to do what was required of them, on
condition that the Justiciar and all other holders of royal property
should at once do likewise. Stephen answered eagerly,
“It is meet that there be such a distribution of castles as shall
make all parties equal without scandal.”<a name="Anchor_945" id="Anchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 945.">[945]</a> On this a universal
surrender was made in legal form by the delivery of a glove
or a hat from every individual both of Chester’s party and of
Hubert’s, the two leaders themselves included.<a name="Anchor_946" id="Anchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 946.">[946]</a></p>

<p>Next day (30th December) new custodians were appointed to
twenty-five royal castles. The former castellans thus displaced
were thirteen in number. One of them had, before the
general surrender, resigned on account of ill-health. Of the
remaining twelve, five had been concerned in the recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
attempt to oust the Justiciar&mdash;Ranulf of Chester, William de
Cantelupe, Engelard de Cigogné, Brian de Lisle, and Falkes;
the other seven were either neutral, or distinctly of the
opposite party&mdash;Ralf de Gernon, John Russell, Stephen de
Sedgrave, William Brewer, the Bishop of Norwich, the Earl
of Salisbury, and the Justiciar himself. Out of the seven
royal castles which Hubert had in his charge the only one
not transferred to other keeping was the Tower of London,
of which the custody was traditionally attached to the
justiciarship.<a name="Anchor_947" id="Anchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 947.">[947]</a> On 7th January <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1224</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> orders were given for the
transfer of three more castles&mdash;Winchester, Porchester, and
Southampton, all in the custody of Bishop Peter; and on
2nd February the lands of the young heir to the earldom of
Devon, and the castles which formed part of them, were
committed to a new warden in place of the boy’s stepfather,
Falkes.<a name="Anchor_948" id="Anchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 948.">[948]</a> The actual displacement of castellans consequent
on the surrender of 29th December, 1223, seems to have ended
here. By that surrender several royal castles which make no
appearance in the Rolls at this time must have been, like the
others, placed legally in the King’s hands; but he seems to
have neither appointed new wardens to them, nor re-committed
them to their existing wardens; these latter were simply left
in possession, as they had originally been appointed, during
the King’s pleasure. Even members of the party opposed to
Hubert were in this informal way suffered to retain some of
their wardenships; Falkes lost&mdash;at that moment&mdash;only three
of the many royal castles which he held;<a name="Anchor_949" id="Anchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 949.">[949]</a> Gloucester, which
though assigned to Hubert by Ralf Musard under compulsion
in the autumn of 1223 had never passed actually into Hubert’s
custody, was not taken from Ralf till November, 1225.<a name="Anchor_950" id="Anchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 950.">[950]</a> On
the other hand, although only five sheriffs were displaced,
their displacement involved the transfer of thirteen shires
to other hands, and four of the five men were opponents of
Hubert; the fifth, John Russell, was merely removed from
Somerset to the joint sheriffdom of Leicestershire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Warwickshire, taken from William de Cantelupe. On the
same day&mdash;30th December, 1223&mdash;the Earl of Chester lost the
shrievalties of Lancashire, Shropshire, and Staffordshire, and
Falkes lost two out of his seven shires; on 18th January <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1224</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> he was
deprived of four more, Rutland alone being left to him; and
in the interval, on 7th January, Bishop Peter was deprived of
the sheriffdom of Hampshire. Considering the recent political
alliance between Chester, Cantelupe, and Falkes, and the
geographical relation to one another (and also, in the case of
Chester’s shires, to his own Palatine county and to the Welsh
border) of the shires thus taken from them, their dispossession
was a reasonable precaution. Bishop Peter’s deprivation of
his sheriffdom and wardenships may have been likewise
dictated by prudence or suspicion; but suspicion, if it existed,
was veiled beneath an appearance of courtesy; it was not till
a week after the letters had been issued for the displacement
of the other sheriffs and castellans that he was called upon to
hand over Hampshire and its castles to a brother bishop,
Richard of Salisbury.</p>

<p>Fifteen of the other twenty-five redistributed castles were
committed to prelates<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>1223<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>. Bristol was transferred to its diocesan
bishop, Jocelyn of Bath, from Bishop Pandulf of Norwich;
the other fourteen had been in the charge of laymen. Jocelyn
of Bath was also entrusted with one of these castles,
Sherborne; eleven were committed to the bishops (in one
case the archbishop) of the dioceses in which they respectively
stood; the other two&mdash;Windsor and Odiham&mdash;to Archbishop
Stephen.<a name="Anchor_951" id="Anchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 951.">[951]</a> These appointments, all made on 30th December,
1223, were evidently not meant to be of long duration; their
object was to give the King and his advisers time for considering
more fully how best to dispose of the castles, of which the
greater number would meanwhile be in the keeping of
guardians whose neutral position afforded the deprived
castellans no ground for jealousy or suspicion. The arrangement
seems however to have worked so well that very little
modification of it was found necessary for several years.
Its author was probably the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Throughout the proceedings at Northampton he seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
have acted as spokesman on the King’s side; as head of the
commission charged with the execution of the papal mandate
on which those proceedings were based, he was most likely
entrusted by Henry with the conduct of them. Falkes says
that immediately after the surrender “the Archbishop,
distributing the castles by word of mouth, deprived all the
barons alike of their possessions.” The letters patent issued
next day were no doubt drawn up according to this verbal
distribution; but, as we have seen, the actual results were far
less sweeping than the words of Falkes imply. A charge of
unfair dealing which is brought by Falkes and by another
writer of the time against the King and his advisers on this
occasion has met with a more ready acceptance than, perhaps,
it deserved. “While,” says Falkes, “the Earl of Chester and
his friends made a real bodily restitution of their castles, the
Justiciar and his party held theirs as before.”<a name="Anchor_952" id="Anchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 952.">[952]</a> “When the
castles were surrendered,” says Ralf of Coggeshall, “the King
gave back to Hubert his wardenships, the other castellans
being deprived of theirs.”<a name="Anchor_953" id="Anchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 953.">[953]</a> The evidence of the Rolls on
this point is unfortunately very meagre and incomplete; they
contain scarcely any information about the royal castles
during the next eight years and more. We find, however,
in the list of castles held by Hubert at his fall in 1232
only four out of the seven which he had held in 1223: the
Tower, Dover, Rochester, and Canterbury.<a name="Anchor_954" id="Anchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 954.">[954]</a> The first seems
never to have been taken from him.<a name="Anchor_955" id="Anchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 955.">[955]</a> Rochester was re-committed
to him on 26th March, 1225,<a name="Anchor_956" id="Anchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 956.">[956]</a> and Dover not much
later, perhaps even earlier.<a name="Anchor_957" id="Anchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 957.">[957]</a> The delivery of Canterbury to
the Archbishop may never have been enforced; but it is
equally possible that Hubert may not have regained the
custody of this castle till after Stephen’s death, in 1228.<a name="Anchor_958" id="Anchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 958.">[958]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
This evidence, though not sufficient to determine precisely
how much of truth or of error is contained either in Falkes’s
assertion or in Ralf’s, does suffice to show that neither the
baron’s version of the matter nor the chronicler’s is altogether
exact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1224</div>

<p>Some at least of the deprived castellans, however, who had
probably hoped for speedy re-instatement, were disappointed
at not getting it,<a name="Anchor_959" id="Anchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 959.">[959]</a> and not less disappointed at the failure of
the attempt to oust Hubert from the justiciarship. The
nobler spirits among the malcontents seem to have fallen back,
almost immediately after the surrender at Northampton,
upon a more pacific and legitimate expedient for curbing his
masterfulness and guarding themselves against the danger of
government by “unjust laws.” On the octave of Epiphany,
when the court reassembled in London, the King “was
requested by the Archbishop of Canterbury and other
magnates to confirm the liberties and free customs for which
war had been waged against his father.”<a name="Anchor_960" id="Anchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 960.">[960]</a> The King’s <i>quasi</i>-majority
afforded an obvious occasion for such a request.
The Great Charter had been twice renewed in his name, but
at a time when he was too young to understand the
responsibilities to which it pledged him. Now that he was
recognized as “a man in wisdom and understanding,”
personally answerable for “the disposition of his realm,” he
might fairly be asked to grant a new confirmation of the
Charter, which those who asked for it doubtless hoped would
be an end of all strife. It was only natural that on this
matter Stephen de Langton should be spokesman; and he
spoke urgently, pleading that the King “could not evade
doing this, since at the departure of Louis he and all the
nobility of the realm with him had sworn that they would all
observe, and cause to be observed by all others, the liberties
written down aforetime.” William Brewer took upon himself
to answer for the King: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>“The liberties which ye ask for
ought rightly not to be observed, because they were extorted
by violence.” “William,” exclaimed the Archbishop, “if you
loved the King, you would not thus stand in the way of the
peace of his realm.” Then, says the chronicler, “the King,
seeing the Archbishop moved to anger, said: ‘These liberties
we have all sworn, and what we have sworn we are all bound
to observe.’”<a name="Anchor_961" id="Anchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 961.">[961]</a></p>

<p>With a boy’s simplicity the young King had unconsciously
passed judgement on the demand which had just been made
to him and on the repeated demands for confirmation of the
Charters which resound through the history of the next
seventy years. He had sworn to maintain the liberties which
he was asked to confirm; he was bound by his oath; no
amount of repetitions could make that oath any more binding
than it was already, and no amount of confirmations could
really give any additional security for its observance. But
behind the question of confirmation lay, probably, a question
of definition. One article, at least, of the Charter as
republished in 1217 left a wide field open for contention: the
forty-sixth article, which reserved to all the King’s subjects
“the liberties and free customs which they formerly had.”
This clause had replaced the one in the Charter of 1216 which
reserved for future consideration certain important articles in
the Great Charter of 1215.<a name="Anchor_962" id="Anchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 962.">[962]</a> It is probable that what Stephen
and the magnates with whom he was acting&mdash;whoever
these may have been&mdash;really wanted was a revision of the
Charter, to include the substitution of some definite provisions
on these reserved points for the vague saving clause of 1217.
If so, William Brewer’s attitude must have shewn them that
the cleavage of political opinion within the royal Council was
too sharp for agreement on the subject to be possible at that
moment. For the observance of the Charter as it stood they
had the word of the King, and there was no reason to expect
that the King would be worse than his word.<a name="Anchor_963" id="Anchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 963.">[963]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>Still Chester and his friends persevered in their efforts to
undermine the position of the Justiciar; and some of them
were equally desirous of undermining that of the Primate.
These now despatched two messengers to Rome, ostensibly
to report to the Pope on the state of affairs in England. The
Archbishop, suspecting mischief, compelled these envoys before
they sailed to swear to him and some of his suffragans that
they “would attempt nothing prejudicial to the King and the
realm”&mdash;the actual meaning of the oath being, they were
given to understand, that they were not to ask for a legate.<a name="Anchor_964" id="Anchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 964.">[964]</a>
This, however, was precisely what they did. Urged one way
by their entreaties and another by Stephen’s protests and
his assurances that no legatine intervention was needed to
preserve peace in the land, Honorius at last decided to send
not a legate, but merely commissioners; further tidings from
England induced him to abandon even this project.<a name="Anchor_965" id="Anchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 965.">[965]</a> At a
council in London on 21st–23rd April,<a name="Anchor_966" id="Anchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 966.">[966]</a> the Archbishop with
tears implored the barons to agree together in peace for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
public good.<a name="Anchor_967" id="Anchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 967.">[967]</a> Chester and all others who had been at strife
with the Justiciar yielded to this appeal; the kiss of peace
was given and accepted on both sides, and the King, “willing
to forget past injuries,” received into his peace and favour all
who had offended against him, “hoping,” as he wrote to the
Pope, “to receive from all and singular such effectual counsel
and aid as they in their necessities are entitled to expect
from us.”<a name="Anchor_968" id="Anchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 968.">[968]</a></p>

<p>There was urgent need of peace at home; for strife was
raging in Ireland, and grave danger was hanging over Poitou.
Geoffrey de Marsh had, as we have seen, formally resigned the
Justiciarship of the Irish March in October, 1221;<a name="Anchor_969" id="Anchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 969.">[969]</a> but he
had contrived to hamper his successor, Archbishop Henry of

records necessary for the Justiciar’s official work in his own
hands till July, 1222, if not later still.<a name="Anchor_970" id="Anchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 970.">[970]</a> Some months before
this the return of Hugh de Lacy gave token of trouble to
come. In John’s reign Hugh had been Earl of Ulster, and
his brother Walter Lord of Meath; both had incurred
forfeiture and exile in 1214. Walter’s reinstatement had been
ordered by John on 6th July, 1215,<a name="Anchor_971" id="Anchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 971.">[971]</a> but Geoffrey de Marsh&mdash;who
was appointed Justiciar on the same day&mdash;never carried
out the order; in November, 1221, Archbishop Henry was
bidden to do so without further delay.<a name="Anchor_972" id="Anchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 972.">[972]</a> Hugh, driven by the
Albigensians from his place of refuge on the Continent, had
then recently come under a safe-conduct to England.<a name="Anchor_973" id="Anchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 973.">[973]</a> Thence
he seems to have gone into Wales. Some lands which he
had held under his brother, and those which formed the dower
of his wife, were restored to him on 27th December, 1222.<a name="Anchor_974" id="Anchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 974.">[974]</a>
In the spring of 1223 he went to Ireland without the King’s
leave.<a name="Anchor_975" id="Anchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 975.">[975]</a> There he stirred up so much mischief that in June<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
the English government, after an ineffectual attempt to induce
his brother Walter and the Earls of Chester, Salisbury, and
Gloucester to undertake the custody of his lands for five
years,<a name="Anchor_976" id="Anchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 976.">[976]</a> deemed it advisable to establish throughout the
English dominions in Ireland a new system of provincial
government by seneschals who, under the supreme authority
of the chief Justiciar, should be “both willing and able to
guard against the King’s damage, and manfully make war
against his enemies when necessity should arise.”<a name="Anchor_977" id="Anchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 977.">[977]</a> John
Marshal, who in February had been sent as assistant justiciar
to help the Archbishop,<a name="Anchor_978" id="Anchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 978.">[978]</a> now received the custody of the
territories of Cork, Des, and Desmond, with their castles;<a name="Anchor_979" id="Anchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 979.">[979]</a>
Richard de Burgh (Hubert’s brother), who already held the
honour of Limerick, was named seneschal of Munster and
constable of Limerick castle;<a name="Anchor_980" id="Anchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 980.">[980]</a> William de Serland was
appointed seneschal of Ulster.<a name="Anchor_981" id="Anchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 981.">[981]</a> Walter de Lacy, who since
1215 had been steadily loyal to the English Crown, was in
England; but his men in Ireland gave shelter and support to
his rebel brother, under whose command they committed
grievous “excesses” on the King’s land, harrying and burning,
and slaying or putting to ransom the men of the King.<a name="Anchor_982" id="Anchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 982.">[982]</a> In
one of his raids Hugh nearly reached Dublin, and the
Justiciar-Archbishop, taken at unawares, was forced to buy of
him a truce till next summer.<a name="Anchor_983" id="Anchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 983.">[983]</a> Before it expired, a singular
compact was made, in the early spring of 1224, between the
King and Walter de Lacy. In consideration, on the one hand,
of Walter’s faithful service, and on the other, of his legal
responsibility for the misdoings of the men of Meath, it was
agreed that the King should hold one of Walter’s English
castles and one of his Irish ones&mdash;Ludlow and Trim&mdash;for two
years from Easter (14th April); that Walter should go to
Ireland <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>“and fight to the uttermost of his power, with the
King’s help, against the men who had done these things”;
that when he should have thus won back control over his own
lands, the King should hold them for a year and a day, “and
after that there shall be done to Walter concerning them
whatever the King’s court shall decide.” Meanwhile Walter
was to have free use of Trim castle for the purposes of this
war against his own men.<a name="Anchor_984" id="Anchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 984.">[984]</a> The trouble which Hugh had
stirred up, however, was evidently felt to require, above all
things, the presence in Ireland of a military leader, instead of
an ecclesiastic, as the chief representative of the Crown. On
23rd April Earl William of Pembroke and Leinster was
married to his promised bride, the King’s nine years old sister
Eleanor;<a name="Anchor_985" id="Anchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 985.">[985]</a> within a month he sailed for Ireland to enter upon
his duties as chief Justiciar in Archbishop Henry’s stead.<a name="Anchor_986" id="Anchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 986.">[986]</a></p>

<p>A yet graver peril than that which disturbed the King’s
“land of Ireland” was that which threatened his “land of
Poitou.” The truce with France had just expired on Easter
day, 14th April.<a name="Anchor_987" id="Anchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 987.">[987]</a> Ever since the previous October the English
government had known, from the lips of Louis himself, that
he was only awaiting its expiration to assemble his host for
the conquest of Henry’s remaining continental territories;
yet to meet his attack they seem to have made no preparation,
except a final effort to secure the support of Hugh of
Lusignan. On 15th January it was proposed to satisfy the
claims of Hugh and Isabel by granting to them, in compensation
for Isabel’s lost dower-lands in Normandy, the
Stannaries in Devonshire and the revenues of Aylesbury for
four years from the ensuing Easter; for the arrears due to
Isabel since her second marriage, three thousand pounds of
money of Touraine, to be paid within three years from
Easter; and for their claim to Niort, one hundred marks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
annually (“although Niort is not worth that sum a year,”
adds her royal son or his minister) to Isabel for life. If the
King of France should invade Poitou within the four years,
Hugh was to have “a reasonable aid” for the defence of
Henry’s land; and in case of Isabel’s death Hugh was to
keep for the same period the lands which he already held,
except what he had “taken in the King’s service”<a name="Anchor_988" id="Anchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 988.">[988]</a> and the
custody of the castle of Mausy, which had been for some
time past in dispute between Henry and Hugh, and which
Henry reserved to himself.<a name="Anchor_989" id="Anchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 989.">[989]</a> A modified form of these
proposals was accepted by Hugh at the end of March. The
annual sum promised in compensation for Niort was doubled;
the three thousand pounds Tournois for arrears were to be
all paid up at Whitsuntide of the current year; there was no
express mention of Mausy, but it was conceded that Hugh
and his wife, or the survivor of them, should keep for four
years from Easter whatever they were seised of on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Andrew’s
day last past; whether this definition would or would not
include Mausy does not appear.<a name="Anchor_990" id="Anchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 990.">[990]</a> Hugh was to swear that
he would serve the King faithfully; and the Pope was to be
requested to enforce, if necessary, the keeping of this agreement.<a name="Anchor_991" id="Anchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 991.">[991]</a>
In accordance with it, Hugh was on 8th April asked
to seize for Henry, as soon as the truce should be ended, the
lands of a certain man “who was with the King of France.”<a name="Anchor_992" id="Anchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 992.">[992]</a>
About the same time the sheriffs throughout England seem
to have been ordered to seize into the King’s hand all lands
held by Normans and Bretons&mdash;meaning, probably, such as
had lands on both sides of the sea and were by reason of
their continental possessions subjects of the French King. To
this order, however, it was soon found advisable to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
some considerable exceptions.<a name="Anchor_993" id="Anchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 993.">[993]</a> At the eleventh hour Louis
suddenly offered to prolong the truce for ten years.<a name="Anchor_994" id="Anchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 994.">[994]</a> On
28th April&mdash;a fortnight after Easter&mdash;three envoys were sent
from England to speak with him about prolonging it for
four years.<a name="Anchor_995" id="Anchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 995.">[995]</a> He seems to have given them an audience, in
presence of his Council, on 5th May;<a name="Anchor_996" id="Anchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 996.">[996]</a> but the negotiations
were unsuccessful. Louis’s proposal had been prompted by
a desire to free his hands for another expedition against
Toulouse, where the Albigensians were again in the ascendent,
and the Pope was anxious for the intervention of the French
King.<a name="Anchor_997" id="Anchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 997.">[997]</a> The reason for the English counter-proposal is plain.
In a little over four years Henry must needs be acknowledged
as of full age in every respect; it was not right that after that
time his hands should be tied by an engagement of such
importance made while he was still in some sense a minor;
if the truce was to be renewed, it must be only until his
coming of age. Louis, however, insisted upon ten years or
nothing.<a name="Anchor_998" id="Anchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 998.">[998]</a> On 15th May, therefore, Henry by letters patent
announced that his truce with France was ended, and bade
the chief English seaport towns make their ships ready for
service at call, detain all vessels which should enter their
harbours, and suffer none which were there to go out without
his special leave.<a name="Anchor_999" id="Anchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 999.">[999]</a></p>

<p>It was scarcely conceivable that Louis would make any
attempt upon England before he had secured Poitou; we
should therefore naturally have supposed that the ships thus
collected were required for the transport of troops to assist
Savaric de Mauléon in the defence of that country. The only
troops actually sent, however, consisted of about a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
knights and an unspecified number of men-at-arms<a name="Anchor_1000" id="Anchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1000.">[1000]</a> commanded
by Richard de Gray and Geoffrey de Neville,<a name="Anchor_1001" id="Anchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1001.">[1001]</a> and
destined to reinforce the garrison of La Rochelle.<a name="Anchor_1002" id="Anchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1002.">[1002]</a> This force
appears to have sailed at the end of May or in the first days
of June.<a name="Anchor_1003" id="Anchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1003.">[1003]</a> It was despatched “by the advice of the magnates
of England”<a name="Anchor_1004" id="Anchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1004.">[1004]</a>&mdash;that is, of the council which had been assembled
in London for the reconciliation of Hubert and his opponents.
That council then dispersed under orders to meet again
at Northampton,<a name="Anchor_1005" id="Anchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1005.">[1005]</a> on the octave of Trinity Sunday,<a name="Anchor_1006" id="Anchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1006.">[1006]</a> 16th June,
“for the purpose”&mdash;so Henry himself wrote to the Pope&mdash;“of
giving us (the King) counsel and rendering us aid for the
defence of our land in Poitou.”<a name="Anchor_1007" id="Anchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1007.">[1007]</a> The nature of the proposed
“aid” cannot be determined with certainty from the King’s
words; they might stand either for personal assistance in the
field, or monetary aid instead of service, or for both. The
question about the obligation of military service beyond sea
was still unsettled; and from the expressions used by some
writers of the time we should gather that the ostensible purpose
for which the barons were summoned to Northampton was
merely to concert measures for the preservation of the King’s
transmarine dominions.<a name="Anchor_1008" id="Anchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1008.">[1008]</a> It is however scarcely credible that
if the King and his ministers really desired to consult further
with the barons about this most urgent business, the council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
actually assembled in London should not have been detained
there for that purpose, instead of being dismissed for seven
weeks and then reassembled elsewhere in the middle of June
to discuss a matter which ought in fact to have passed from
the stage of consultation to that of action by the middle of May.
According to Falkes, on the other hand, the summons was for a
muster of the host in arms.<a name="Anchor_1009" id="Anchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1009.">[1009]</a> A statement made some years later
by Hubert seems to confirm this version of the story,<a name="Anchor_1010" id="Anchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1010.">[1010]</a> and we
shall see from the sequel that the majority, if not all, of the
barons went to Northampton attended by their followers in
arms. There is, however, reason to believe that, if not in the
mind of the young King himself, at least in that of his chief
adviser, Poitou was not the real or at any rate the first
destination of the host.</p>

<p>The changes in the custody of royal castles and wardenships
ordered early in the year seem to have been effected without
serious difficulty or delay, except with regard to one castle,<a name="Anchor_1011" id="Anchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1011.">[1011]</a>
Plympton. The King claimed the custody of Plympton on
the ground that it formed part of the honour of Devon, which
had belonged to the late Earl William of Devon, or “of the
Isle” (of Wight), as he was sometimes called, father of
Baldwin de Rivers, whose widow, Margaret, was the wife of
Falkes de Bréauté. Falkes and Margaret had been married
during Earl William’s lifetime, in 1215;<a name="Anchor_1012" id="Anchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1012.">[1012]</a> but William <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1215–1218</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> was
very unwilling to give his daughter-in-law and her new
husband seisin of the dower-lands to which she was entitled as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Baldwin’s widow, and her claims were still unsettled when he
died in September, 1217.<a name="Anchor_1013" id="Anchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1013.">[1013]</a> They were settled at last by the
regent Earl Marshal, on 30th March, 1218, when “the
honour of Plympton, with the castle of Plympton, and all the
land which belonged to the Earl of the Isle in Devonshire,”
was by royal letter patent granted to Falkes and Margaret
“as the same Margaret’s dower.”<a name="Anchor_1014" id="Anchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1014.">[1014]</a> On 16th February, 1224,
Henry transferred the custody of the Earl’s castles in Hampshire
and of all the lands which had been his, “except his
lands in Devon and the castle of Plympton,” to Waleran the
German.<a name="Anchor_1015" id="Anchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1015.">[1015]</a> So far as we know, Falkes complied with this
order. On 13th March he was informed by letter patent
that the King had committed Plympton castle (“which,”
wrote Henry, “was given into your keeping by the elder
William Marshal when he was governor of ourself and our
realm”) to Walter de Falkenberg, and if Falkes were unwilling
to deliver it to Walter, he must come to London at
Mid-Lent (21st March), and deliver it there to the King in
person.<a name="Anchor_1016" id="Anchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1016.">[1016]</a> Falkes seemingly declined to deliver it at all, on
the plea&mdash;for which, as has been seen, he had an excellent
warrant&mdash;that he held it not in custody for the Crown, but as
part of his wife’s dower. On 21st March the King wrote
again, expressing his astonishment that Falkes had not made
the expected delivery, and bidding him make it to Walter at
once; “for,” wrote the King, “we are certain that that castle
is the head of the Earl of Devon’s honour in Devonshire, and
for that reason your wife neither can nor ought to have it in
dower. If, however, she has less than she ought to have in
dower of the land of her former husband, we will make
up what is due to her according to the custom of our realm;
but if she has more than she should have, we will have it
measured according to justice.”<a name="Anchor_1017" id="Anchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1017.">[1017]</a> The tone of these letters
suggests that the King and his advisers, though determined to
carry their point, were conscious of having undertaken a
somewhat formidable task in committing themselves to a
dispute with Falkes.</p>

<p>Seven men and one woman bearing the surname <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>“de
Bréauté” occur in the official records of England under
John and Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> Four at least of the men were brothers

near Havre must have been the original home of the family,
whose first member to appear in history is Falkes. Several
chroniclers tell us that he was a native of Normandy.<a name="Anchor_1019" id="Anchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1019.">[1019]</a> After

singular personal appellation was according to one account
not a Christian name, but a nickname derived from “the
scythe” (<i lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">faus</i> or <i lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">fauc</i> in the contemporary speech of his native

thought that it had been given to him&mdash;whether at the font

whose sons, legitimate and other, left their paternal
fields and came to England, like the family of Gerard of
Athée, because they preferred to live in exile under their
hereditary sovereign rather than in their own land under his
conqueror.<a name="Anchor_1025" id="Anchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1025.">[1025]</a> Another statement concerning Falkes which
lacks confirmation is that he began life as a domestic servant
of the King, in the capacity of “door-keeper.”<a name="Anchor_1026" id="Anchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1026.">[1026]</a> The word
used is an ambiguous one; the writer apparently wished his

In February, 1207, at any rate, <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1207–1214</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> Falkes was made keeper of
something else than the palace doors&mdash;the land of Glamorgan
and the honour of Wenlock on the Marches of Wales.<a name="Anchor_1028" id="Anchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1028.">[1028]</a>
When he received this appointment he was a “sergeant,” or
man-at-arms, “of the King”;<a name="Anchor_1029" id="Anchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1029.">[1029]</a> probably it was on this
occasion that John bestowed on him the honour of knighthood.<a name="Anchor_1030" id="Anchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1030.">[1030]</a>
These wardenships were held by Falkes for seven
years, and he was also during part of that time constable of
Caermarthen, Cardiff, and Gower.<a name="Anchor_1031" id="Anchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1031.">[1031]</a> Within the important
military sphere thus assigned to him he was given the fullest
freedom of action; his valour, capability, and honesty were
all alike trusted implicitly by the King, who employed him
also on other business such as the payment of troops and
other persons and the transport of money and treasure both
in England and abroad.<a name="Anchor_1032" id="Anchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1032.">[1032]</a> John, like most of the Angevin
counts, was an excellent judge of men, and he had quickly
discerned that Falkes, “though little of stature, was very
valiant,”<a name="Anchor_1033" id="Anchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1033.">[1033]</a> and that moreover he was gifted with a versatile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
capability and a thoroughness which almost matched those of
the Angevin house itself. The writers of the time, while
denouncing Falkes as “a rod of the Lord’s fury”<a name="Anchor_1034" id="Anchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1034.">[1034]</a> and
describing him as a monster of wickedness, unanimously
acknowledge that his rise from poverty and obscurity to
wealth, rank, and power was due to his conspicuous military
talents, his dauntless valour, and the tireless energy and
fidelity with which he served his royal master.<a name="Anchor_1035" id="Anchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1035.">[1035]</a> In January,
1214<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>1214–1216<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>, on the marriage of the King’s cousin Isabel of
Gloucester to the Earl of Essex, Glamorgan passed with the
rest of the lands appertaining to her honour of Gloucester
into the hands of her husband; and at the same time
Caermarthen, Cardiff, and Gower were transferred from the
keeping of Falkes to that of the Earl Marshal.<a name="Anchor_1036" id="Anchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1036.">[1036]</a> The King
however gave Falkes plenty of occupation and compensation
elsewhere. Early in 1215 Falkes was acting as a seneschal
or steward of the King’s household.<a name="Anchor_1037" id="Anchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1037.">[1037]</a> Meanwhile, as constable
of Wenlock, he still retained the command of an important
district on the Welsh March.<a name="Anchor_1038" id="Anchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1038.">[1038]</a> There he gathered round him
a picked band of kinsmen and followers who in 1215 and 1216
proved the most efficient and trustworthy section of the
troops that fought for the Crown against the barons and the
French invader.<a name="Anchor_1039" id="Anchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1039.">[1039]</a> It was but natural that his services should be
rewarded by the bestowal of large grants of land taken from
the King’s enemies. This was the only way in which John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
could furnish him with means to continue those services, and
it was also a most effectual way of securing that those lands
should not fall back into the hands of the opposite party.
The commission of seven shires in Mid-England to his
custody as sheriff was a measure of policy, amply justified by
its results in the struggle with Louis after John’s death, when
the garrisons under the command of Falkes formed across
the realm a chain which Louis never succeeded in breaking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1215–1224</div>

<p>In 1215 John bestowed on Falkes the hand of Margaret de
Rivers, a grant which should have carried with it the enjoyment
of her dower-lands; but this, as has been seen, Margaret
and Falkes did not obtain till March, 1218.<a name="Anchor_1040" id="Anchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1040.">[1040]</a> Then the
regent also granted to Falkes, to hold “until the King’s
coming of age,” the custody of the person of Margaret’s
young son by her first husband, and of all the lands and
castles which had belonged to the boy’s late grandfather Earl
William of Devon and Wight, and to which the boy himself
was now heir.<a name="Anchor_1041" id="Anchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1041.">[1041]</a> Thus throughout the next six years the
extensive possessions of the house of Rivers were in Falkes’s
hands; for practical purposes he represented that great house
and was, as a contemporary says, “made equal to an Earl.”<a name="Anchor_1042" id="Anchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1042.">[1042]</a>
The other magnates, some of whom seem to have resented
the necessity of admitting even Hubert de Burgh to social
equality with themselves, naturally resented still more the
intrusion into their ranks of one whom they looked upon as a
mere upstart stranger. Moreover he came into collision with
more than one of them through his autocratic dealing with
the lands held by them in the shires under his command; and
the violently abusive language in which, when his fiery
temper was roused, he railed at some of the greatest men of
the land and at the English nation in general, gave almost as
much offence as his more substantial misdoings.<a name="Anchor_1043" id="Anchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1043.">[1043]</a> The clergy
and religious orders, especially the monks of the great abbey
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Alban’s&mdash;by one of whom later historians, for the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
part, have been somewhat unduly influenced in their views of
men and things in the reign of John and the early years of
Henry&mdash;had other reasons for detesting Falkes. Cruelty and
rapacity were common, more or less, in all medieval warfare,
and the spoiling of churches and monasteries was a form of ill-doing
of which neither party in the civil war was altogether
guiltless; but in these matters Falkes stood without a peer
save John himself. His crowning outrage was committed in
1217, when in the dusk of a January morning he fell
suddenly upon <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Alban’s, captured and plundered the town,
carried off its inhabitants to prison in his own castles, slew a
servant of the abbey at the very door of the church, and by a
threat of burning down the whole place wrung from the abbot
a ransom of a hundred pounds of silver.<a name="Anchor_1044" id="Anchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1044.">[1044]</a> The spoil, however,
went to maintain the soldiers who, if they were the
fiercest and most ruthless, were also the most daring and the
most uniformly successful troops in the service of the young
King. They and their leader played, as we have seen, an
important part in the battle of Lincoln; and whatever may
have been the personal feelings of Henry’s guardians and
counsellors towards Falkes, time after time throughout the
early years of the minority, when a man of prompt and
vigorous action was wanted for some specially awkward or
unpleasant piece of work, Falkes was the man on whom they
relied, and they never relied on him in vain. It was Falkes
who was set to keep the King’s uncle from intruding into a
royal castle of which he was not the lawful custodian. It
was Falkes whom Hubert de Burgh employed to overawe
the riotous citizens of London and to rid him of their
dangerous leader. In their hearts, however, Hubert and
Falkes were rivals, urged to secret mutual jealousy by a
characteristic which, unlike as they were in other respects, was
common to them both; when once they had risen to power
and authority, neither of them was inclined to brook an equal.<a name="Anchor_1045" id="Anchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1045.">[1045]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Accordingly, Falkes had joined Chester and the other discontented
magnates in their effort to rid themselves of the
Justiciar; and when that effort had failed, Justiciar, magnates,
and King, having none of them any further use for Falkes,
joined hands to rid themselves of him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1224</div>

<p>Three days after the council of reconciliation in London,
had dispersed in April, 1224, a charge of capital crime, said
to have been committed eight years previously, was laid before
the King against Falkes.<a name="Anchor_1046" id="Anchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1046.">[1046]</a> A writ was at once issued, on
26th April, to the sheriff of Bedfordshire bidding him “at every
shire-court call Falkes de Bréauté to stand to right concerning
the complaint made against him in that county, of a breach of
the King’s peace,” and if Falkes did not appear, cause him to
be outlawed. On 28th May the sheriff was told to call Falkes
at his next shire-court, which was to be on the Monday after
the octave of Trinity (17th June), as he had previously done,
but the outlawry was to be respited till further orders. Two
days later (30th May) this respite was countermanded; if on
the appointed Monday Falkes did not answer, the sheriff was
bidden to outlaw him at once.<a name="Anchor_1047" id="Anchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1047.">[1047]</a> In Whitsun week, 2nd–8th June,
certain of the justices in eyre went to hold pleas of novel
disseisin at Dunstable.<a name="Anchor_1048" id="Anchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1048.">[1048]</a> One of these justices, Henry de
Braybroke, had long been at enmity with Falkes’s brother
William, and now found an opportunity which he was not
slow to use against William and Falkes both at once. He
deprived William&mdash;such at least is Falkes’s story&mdash;of some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
his lands and other possessions without trial.<a name="Anchor_1049" id="Anchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1049.">[1049]</a> He insisted,
seemingly without warrant, on the payment by both the
brothers of certain dues and arrears which they owed to the
Crown.<a name="Anchor_1050" id="Anchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1050.">[1050]</a> Sixteen pleas of forcible disseisin were brought
before him against Falkes; in every case Falkes was convicted,
and sentenced to pay a heavy fine.<a name="Anchor_1051" id="Anchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1051.">[1051]</a></p>

<p>William de Bréauté was at this time commandant, under
his brother Falkes, of the castle of Bedford. After the close
of the assizes at Dunstable, on 17th June&mdash;the day on which
Falkes was to be called for the last time in the Bedford shire-court&mdash;Henry
de Braybroke, on his way to join the council
which had assembled on the previous day at Northampton,
was captured by William de Bréauté and carried as a prisoner
to Bedford.<a name="Anchor_1052" id="Anchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1052.">[1052]</a> Some of his companions who escaped capture
spread the tidings abroad; his wife hurried to Northampton
and laid her complaint before the King and the Council.<a name="Anchor_1053" id="Anchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1053.">[1053]</a>
Every one believed that the Bréauté brothers had plotted
the outrage between them;<a name="Anchor_1054" id="Anchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1054.">[1054]</a> Falkes’s account of the matter
is that William had acted half in wantonness, half in
vengeance, and wholly without the knowledge of Falkes
himself.<a name="Anchor_1055" id="Anchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1055.">[1055]</a> Even if this were so, however, Falkes was legally
responsible for the action of his sub-castellan and for a
prisoner immured in a castle which was under his charge.
Where Falkes was, does not appear. He was clearly not at
the county court at Bedford; but as soon as the capture of the
judge became known, he hurried to the castle.<a name="Anchor_1056" id="Anchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1056.">[1056]</a> According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
to his own account, his purpose was to set the judge at liberty
but when he reached the castle prisoner and castellan had
both disappeared; William had hidden himself and his
captive in the neighbouring Forest of Wabridge<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>18 June<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>. Two knights
had meanwhile been despatched with a citation to Falkes
to appear at Northampton on the morrow (19th June) and
answer to the King in person for the seizure of the judge and
for “all other matters which should be brought against him.”
Falkes hereupon sent, on the 19th, messengers to the Earls of
Winchester and Chester, begging that they would endeavour
to procure him a day’s respite, on the plea that he must first
find his brother<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>19 June<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>. They performed their commission, and the
King appeared disposed to grant their request; but the enemies
of Falkes determined that forcible steps should be taken that
very night;<a name="Anchor_1057" id="Anchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1057.">[1057]</a> and next morning the whole multitude which
had come together at Northampton, King, prelates, barons,
knights, and men-at-arms, appeared before the gate of Bedford
castle.<a name="Anchor_1058" id="Anchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1058.">[1058]</a></p>

<p>The King summoned the garrison to admit him, and
to surrender the castle to the Justiciar. William de Bréauté
had now returned with his prisoner&mdash;if indeed they had ever
really been away&mdash;but Falkes had disappeared in his turn.
William and his knights refused to obey the King’s summons
without instructions from Falkes, “chiefly because they were
not bound by homage or fealty to the King,”<a name="Anchor_1059" id="Anchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1059.">[1059]</a> and also because
Falkes, having taken the Cross,<a name="Anchor_1060" id="Anchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1060.">[1060]</a> was by a privilege from the
Pope entitled, for himself, his lands, and his men, to exemption
from molestation by the secular powers.<a name="Anchor_1061" id="Anchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1061.">[1061]</a> This second plea
might probably have carried some weight with the spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
members of the King’s host, had it not been neutralized by
the other. Feudal law, as understood on the side of the
Channel whence Falkes and his followers had come, recognized
liege homage to a mesne lord as a valid ground for disclaiming
all duty to a suzerain and even a sovereign; but in England
this principle had never been admitted, and was justly held to
be&mdash;in the words of a modern writer&mdash;“the essence of feudal
anarchy.” Disregarding an appeal to the Pope with which
the garrison wound up their defiance of the King, Archbishop
Stephen and the other bishops present acted upon the orders
which they had received from Rome in the preceding year for
dealing with refractory castellans. They lighted their candles
and laid Falkes<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>20 June<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>, his liegemen in the castle, and all their aiders
and abettors, under sentence of excommunication.<a name="Anchor_1062" id="Anchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1062.">[1062]</a> Immediately
afterwards the siege was begun.</p>

<p>On that siege the whole energies of the King’s government
were concentrated for eight weeks; and before half that time
had elapsed Poitou was lost. In May Louis had outbidden
Henry for the support of the Lusignans, and received the
liege homage of Hugh and of his kinsman Geoffrey,
the viscount of Châtelheraut.<a name="Anchor_1063" id="Anchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1063.">[1063]</a> On Midsummer day the
French King’s host mustered at Tours. He led it first to
Montreuil-Bellay; there he met the aged viscount Almeric
of Thouars, who for many years had played in Aquitanian
politics a part almost more important than that of the
Lusignans. With Almeric Louis made a truce for a year.
On 3rd July he laid siege to Niort. Savaric de Mauléon was
there; seeing that he could not, without succour from over
sea, hold the country against Louis, the Lusignans, and
Almeric all united, he surrendered Niort on the 5th and
withdrew to La Rochelle, after swearing on the Gospels that
he would not defend any place except that one beyond All
Saints’ day. Louis advanced next to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Jean d’Angély,
which opened its gates to him. He then marched upon La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Rochelle. Its garrison, headed by Savaric and reinforced by
the men whom he had brought with him from Niort and by
the English knights under Richard de Gray and Geoffrey de
Neville, sallied forth to give battle, and “slew many of the
French,” but were driven back into the city. On the 15th
Louis set up his engines before the walls. He also opened
negotiations with the civic rulers; and the result was that on
3rd August the place was surrendered. The garrison marched
out with the honours of war; the citizens, on the 13th, swore
fealty to Louis.<a name="Anchor_1064" id="Anchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1064.">[1064]</a> The fall of La Rochelle sealed the fate of
Poitou, by cutting off Henry’s remaining partisans there from
their last hope of succour from England. Limoges had
already joined the winning side; Périgord did the like. The
conqueror entered Poitiers without further difficulty, and in
September he returned to Paris, leaving a part of his army,
under a new seneschal whom he had appointed instead of
Savaric, to join Hugh of La Marche in an invasion of
Gascony.<a name="Anchor_1065" id="Anchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1065.">[1065]</a></p>

<p>According to the Barnwell annalist, “it was said by some
persons that Falkes and his supporters suggested to King
Louis that he should invade Poitou; and in order that Louis
might do this freely and without fear or danger, he, Falkes,
promised to keep King Henry so fully occupied with most
urgent business in the middle of his own country that he
would leave his transmarine lands destitute of military
forces.”<a name="Anchor_1066" id="Anchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1066.">[1066]</a> We need hardly go about to demonstrate that
Louis needed no “suggestion” from Falkes or any one else
for the invasion of Poitou. The whole of this absurd story,
avowedly resting only on what “was said by some people,”
would be beneath notice, but that its latter part seems to be
a distorted and exaggerated report of an assertion which
actually was made by Hubert de Burgh and the King.
Before the successes of Louis were known in England, Henry
wrote to the Pope an account of the circumstances which had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
he said, “compelled” him to lay siege to Bedford castle,
“neglecting for the present all the other affairs which are
pressing upon us in Ireland and in Poitou; which imminent
perils,” he added, “we may not unjustly impute to Falkes
and his accomplices.”<a name="Anchor_1067" id="Anchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1067.">[1067]</a> Fifteen years later Henry imputed
the loss of Poitou to Hubert, whom he charged with having
sent to that country barrels filled with stones and sand instead
of money and treasure, whereby the nobles and townsfolk
were so disgusted with the King’s service that they went over
to his enemies. Hubert answered that he had never sent any
such barrels; that by the advice of the magnates of England
over a hundred knights and many men-at-arms had been sent
to Poitou, and remained there till, without their assent, the
burghers of La Rochelle made terms with the enemy, and
thus it was not through negligence on his own part or on that
of the knights that La Rochelle was lost; “but,” he added,
“it was lost through the excesses of Falkes, who with his
people made an insurrection while La Rochelle was besieged.”<a name="Anchor_1068" id="Anchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1068.">[1068]</a>
Hubert’s defence here is self-contradictory; if La Rochelle
was lost not for want of reinforcement but by the wilfulness
of its citizens, no “insurrection” in England could have any
influence in the matter. Practically, however, Hubert admits
that further reinforcements should have been sent, but
insinuates that their despatch was made impossible by the
conduct of Falkes. Thus did King and Justiciar alike, at
different times, seek to cast upon Falkes the responsibility for
a failure which lay at their own door. Even had the host
gathered at Northampton on 16th June been in truth destined
for Poitou, its gathering would have been tardy. But we
cannot believe that its nominal destination was anything else
than a blind. If it were, the choice of the meeting-place
would be inexplicable. No sane commander would, without
any necessity, have chosen to muster an army drawn from all
parts of the realm, and intended for service beyond the
Channel, at Northampton, a town in Mid-England, five days
journey from the sea. For a full half of such an army the
choice would involve literally double toil and trouble&mdash;a long,
toilsome march, from Kent and Sussex, Hampshire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, up to Northampton and then
down again to a place of embarcation on the south coast, to
which some of these contingents could have gone direct in
half the time, while others must have actually come from its
immediate neighbourhood; and all this without any advantage
to their fellow-soldiers from the Midlands and the North, or
to the King himself, all of whom could just as easily have
met them, as had been customary in former reigns, at the port
whence they were to sail.<a name="Anchor_1069" id="Anchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1069.">[1069]</a> The barons were summoned to
Northampton because their help was wanted in the execution
of a project predetermined in the royal Council, for the ruin
of Falkes de Bréauté.</p>

<p>Such a project was, in itself, not without justification.
Falkes seems to have been generally, and deservedly, regarded
as a public nuisance; and his extraordinary personality,
coupled with the peculiar character of the followers under his
control, gave him, even after the loss of all his sheriffdoms and
most of his castles, the power to make himself also a public
danger, if he were so minded. He was, however, not a whit
more of a nuisance and, owing to the events of the past winter,
considerably less of a possible danger at the moment when the
government first took action against him, than he had been
at any time in the past seven or eight years. This was implicitly,
though perhaps unconsciously, admitted by Hubert
when he said that the “insurrection” which&mdash;as he and Henry
alike insinuate&mdash;left King and Council neither time nor energy
nor men to spare for any other object, took place “while La
Rochelle was besieged.” Strictly speaking, this is not correct;
Henry de Braybroke was captured nearly a month before
Louis laid siege to La Rochelle, and, indeed, a week before
the French host set out from Tours. But the statement is
none the less, or rather all the more, a clear proof that the
Justiciar knew of no grounds for charging Falkes with treason
or rebellion<a name="Anchor_1070" id="Anchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1070.">[1070]</a> earlier than the capture of Braybroke; that is to
say, earlier than 17th June, the day after the royal host began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
to assemble at Northampton. That assembly had been
arranged not later than 26th April; its arrangement had been
immediately followed by the raking-up of a charge against
Falkes concerning a matter which dated from the earliest days
of Henry’s reign or even from a time before his accession,
and had apparently never been heard of since; this again had
been followed by Henry de Braybroke’s rigorous dealing
with Falkes and his brother at the Dunstable assizes. All
these legal proceedings may in themselves have been perfectly
just; but, begun thus suddenly, without (so far as can be seen)
any special provocation, and crowded all together at this
particular time, they might well have goaded even a man of
cooler temper than Falkes to play into his enemies’ hands by
committing some outrage which would furnish the government
with an occasion for crushing him completely; and
to crush him the King and his councillors were evidently
already determined, before that outrage was committed. The
abstract justice and wisdom of their determination need not
be discussed here. As a matter of policy, however, the time
for its execution was singularly ill chosen. The moment
when a swarm of locusts was known to be on the point of
advancing upon Poitou was not the moment for stirring
up a hornet’s nest in England. The King paid dearly for
his own share&mdash;whatever it may have been&mdash;in this blunder.
Some share in it, and in all likelihood the larger share, must
have belonged to Hubert; and for Hubert only one possible
excuse can be suggested. As he seems to have underrated the
dangers over sea, so he may, at the outset, have underrated
the difficulty of the task upon which he was entering in
England.<a name="Anchor_1071" id="Anchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1071.">[1071]</a> The muster at Northampton may have been
designed for a mere military demonstration, in the heart of
the lands which had been so long under Falkes’s charge, with
the expectation that Falkes would be thereby overawed into
making complete submission, somewhat as Count William of
Aumale had been overawed in 1220 and 1221, and that the
host might, when it had accomplished this preliminary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
purpose, proceed to the south coast and still reach Poitou
before it was too late. Such an expectation would hardly be
consistent with the knowledge which Hubert must have
possessed of the character and the resources of Falkes. If it
was still entertained by any one when in the dawn of 20th June
the host set out for Bedford, a very brief experience there
must have sufficed to shew that it was utterly hopeless.</p>

<p>In 1215 the constable of Bedford castle, William de
Beauchamp, had incurred forfeiture by welcoming the rebel
barons within its walls. Falkes had regained it for the King,<a name="Anchor_1072" id="Anchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1072.">[1072]</a>
and had been rewarded with a grant of its constableship in

it with walls and outworks and stone-clad ditches and ramparts,
stored it with military engines and arms. Its garrison
in 1224 consisted of eleven knights and a proportionate
number of men-at-arms, all picked men, amply sufficient to
defend a fortress which was generally reputed impregnable.<a name="Anchor_1075" id="Anchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1075.">[1075]</a>
On the other hand, the besiegers were not all as eager about
their task as were the King, the Justiciar, and, it seems, most
of the bishops. The Earls of Chester and Aumale, the
Bishop of Winchester, William de Cantelupe, Brian de Lisle,
Peter de Maulay, had obeyed the King’s summons and
accompanied him to Bedford with their followers, but made
no secret of their lack of sympathy with the object of the
expedition; and after a while Bishop Peter and Earl Ranulf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
finding themselves excluded from the King’s private counsels,
quitted the camp and went each to his own home.<a name="Anchor_1076" id="Anchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1076.">[1076]</a> Meanwhile
urgent orders were being despatched to all parts of the
country for cartloads of ropes, targes, quarrels, pickaxes, tents,
victuals, mangonels and other engines of war, and men to
work the engines.<a name="Anchor_1077" id="Anchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1077.">[1077]</a> The current expenditure which all this
involved was so much more than the treasury could meet
that the Archbishop of Canterbury and other prelates who
were present in the host voluntarily made a grant for the
King’s necessities. “Of their mere grace and liberality,”
those of them who had a portion of land separate from that of
their chapters gave half a mark for every ploughland thus
held by them in demesne; those who had not separate portions
gave two shillings per ploughland from the demesne
lands of their churches; all alike gave two shillings for
every ploughland held by their tenants and sub-tenants, and
for every hide of land, both demesne and enfeoffed, the
personal assistance of two workmen to drag and work the
machines.<a name="Anchor_1078" id="Anchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1078.">[1078]</a> After the close of the siege letters patent were
issued by the King, carefully explaining that this generous
aid had been voted by the prelates purely as a matter of
grace, and was not to constitute a precedent for any future
occasion.<a name="Anchor_1079" id="Anchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1079.">[1079]</a></p>

<p>At the approach of the royal forces Falkes had slipped
away into the territories of the Earl of Chester, where the
King’s writs did not run. There, according to his own account,
he “composed some letters” to the King, asking for a safe-conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
to go to the court and “do whatever the barons and
the laws of the land should require of him”; but this
messenger on reaching the camp and finding that Falkes had
been excommunicated was so afraid of incurring a share in
the excommunication that he went away without delivering
the letters.<a name="Anchor_1080" id="Anchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1080.">[1080]</a> Falkes was said to have told the Bedford
garrison that he would succour them within forty days.<a name="Anchor_1081" id="Anchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1081.">[1081]</a> As
that period drew towards a close the besiegers seem to
have realized that the capture of the man was becoming
almost more important than, and was likely to prove almost
as difficult as, the capture of the castle. A band of men-at-arms
was detached from the siege to go in search of him, but
came back reporting that he had fled into Wales.<a name="Anchor_1082" id="Anchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1082.">[1082]</a> This was
the more alarming because neither Llywelyn’s promised
amends for the Kinnerley affair nor the trial of the claims and
counter-claims arising out of that affair had yet taken place.
The settlement which was to have been made at Candlemas
had been three or four times postponed; each time that a
new date for it was fixed, the King had been too hard pressed
with more urgent business to keep his appointment with
Llywelyn; it now stood fixed for 28th July.<a name="Anchor_1083" id="Anchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1083.">[1083]</a> On 10th July
letters were sent out calling upon all the King’s bailiffs and
other faithful subjects to help in catching “our enemy
Falkes.”<a name="Anchor_1084" id="Anchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1084.">[1084]</a> Two days later the sheriffs of Staffordshire and
Shropshire were told that Falkes was known to have gone
into Wales to form with some of its “mighty men” a league
against the King, but, having failed in this, was expected to
return secretly to England; and they were bidden to search
for him, to order a hue and cry to be raised after him, and
not to let it cease till he was captured.<a name="Anchor_1085" id="Anchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1085.">[1085]</a> Some three weeks
later, as the attainment of that object seemed no nearer, the
King addressed a private letter of appeal or remonstrance to
the Earl of Chester&mdash;who by this time had withdrawn from
the host&mdash;and also one to Llywelyn of Wales. These letters
are lost, but their tenour can be made out from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
replies. Henry appealed, seemingly in justification of his
own conduct, to Ranulf’s personal knowledge of the circumstances
which had led to the siege of Bedford. He declared
that, according to reports which he had received, Falkes was
plotting against him to the uttermost of his power; and he
begged that Ranulf would strive to avert or check any mischief
which might be threatening in his neighbourhood, and if
nothing of the kind seemed to be impending there, at once
return to the camp. Ranulf’s answer was a model of quiet
dignity. He did, he said, know the circumstances relating to
the siege of Bedford, and so did many other persons. Of Sir
Falkes de Bréauté’s reported machinations against the King
he knew nothing; he had only seen and observed Sir Falkes
bear himself patiently under the King’s anger, as one who
desired nothing else than to appease it by his own endeavours
and the help of his friends. For his own part Ranulf was
(he continued) ready now, as ever, to protect the King’s
interests as much as in him lay, and accordingly he had,
on receipt of the King’s letter, immediately gone to confer
with Llywelyn, and obtained his promise to leave the King’s
land in peace for a month from 4th August. Having secured
this, he was, agreeably to Henry’s command, coming back to
the royal presence as quickly as he could.<a name="Anchor_1086" id="Anchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1086.">[1086]</a> To Llywelyn
the King related the capture of Henry de Braybroke and the
steps taken in consequence of it; and he forbade the Prince
to harbour Falkes or his men or to give them aid or counsel.
Llywelyn answered by repeating Falkes’s version of the story
as it had been told him by Falkes in a flying visit of less than
a day’s duration, and refusing to recognize an excommunication
against which he declared that Falkes would be
justified in defending himself even if it came from the Pope
in person.<a name="Anchor_1087" id="Anchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1087.">[1087]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>Baffled in his attempts to capture Falkes, the King swore
“by his father’s soul” that if Bedford castle were taken by
force, he would hang every man who was in it. The garrison
retorted by bidding his messengers see to it that no one came
with any more demands for surrender.<a name="Anchor_1088" id="Anchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1088.">[1088]</a> Formidable as was
the King’s siege train, its work progressed but slowly. A
stone-caster and two mangonels stationed on the east side of
the castle hurled stones all day long at the keep; two other
mangonels battered at the “old tower” on the west side;
two more were gradually making as many breaches in the
outer walls, one on the northern and the other on the
southern side; a “cat” sheltered the ingoing and outgoing
of miners who were digging their way underground to the
foundations of the keep; other machines concealed crossbowmen
and slingers whose missiles, despatched thus by
unseen hands, caught the besieged at unawares; at last two
moveable wooden “castles,” towers, or “belfries,” so lofty
that their occupants could look down into every part of the
castle enclosure, not excepting the keep itself, were constructed
and filled, the one with scouts to watch all the doings of the
garrison, the other with crossbowmen from whose quarrels,
shot down like bolts out of the sky, no man among the
besieged was safe for a moment without his armour.<a name="Anchor_1089" id="Anchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1089.">[1089]</a> Nevertheless
William de Bréauté and his men continued to hurl
projectiles at their assailants;<a name="Anchor_1090" id="Anchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1090.">[1090]</a> in the eight weeks of the siege
the King lost six knights and, it was said, more than two
hundred men-at-arms and labourers working the machines.<a name="Anchor_1091" id="Anchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1091.">[1091]</a>
At length an assault was made upon the barbican; it was
taken, and four or five “foreigners”<a name="Anchor_1092" id="Anchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1092.">[1092]</a> were slain. A second
assault won the outer bailey, where “many were slain,” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
the King’s men “came into possession of horses, harness,
armour, crossbows, bullocks, live pigs, bacon, and other things
innumerable,” besides sheds full of corn and hay which they
burned. Next, the miners succeeded in bringing down a part
of the wall close to the “old tower”; the King’s men rushed
in through the breach, and after a desperate fight in which
many of them perished, they gained possession of the inner
bailey. The keep still defied them; ten of them who tried to
enter it were shut in and kept fast by the garrison.<a name="Anchor_1093" id="Anchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1093.">[1093]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Falkes had been tracked by Bishop Alexander
of Coventry. Alexander had carried the King’s letter to
Earl Ranulf;<a name="Anchor_1094" id="Anchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1094.">[1094]</a> the Bishop of Exeter seems to have joined him
at Coventry, and there these two prelates heard that Falkes
was at a place three miles beyond Chester. They immediately
published his excommunication, and then Alexander went to
seek him in the hope of bringing him to submission.<a name="Anchor_1095" id="Anchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1095.">[1095]</a> To
the bishop’s persuasions Falkes replied that he was ready to
stand to the King’s command and judgement in all things, on
condition that three men whom he believed to be personally
hostile to him<a name="Anchor_1096" id="Anchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1096.">[1096]</a> should not be present; or he would submit
entirely to the King’s judgement and accept his mercy, but
on condition that these same three should have no part in
discussing the terms of that mercy. He further begged that
either he might be released from excommunication by Bishop
Alexander, or the whole case might be submitted to the Pope.
The first part of the message thus brought back by Alexander
to the royal camp was received with jeers; as to the last
point, Archbishop Stephen was resolute that no one but
himself should absolve the culprit. Alexander and Earl
Ranulf went back together to Falkes, and persuaded him to
return with them as far as Coventry.<a name="Anchor_1097" id="Anchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1097.">[1097]</a> Thither, on 12th August,
a safe-conduct was sent to him for himself and the members
of his household who were with him, that they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
come to Northampton for absolution within the next ten
days.<a name="Anchor_1098" id="Anchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1098.">[1098]</a></p>

<p>To Northampton Falkes&mdash;seemingly accompanied by
Bishop Alexander&mdash;came without delay; and thence he
sent word to his soldiers of his inability to help them.<a name="Anchor_1099" id="Anchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1099.">[1099]</a> On
the evening of 14th August the King’s miners kindled a fire
underneath the keep of Bedford castle. The garrison, seated
at supper, saw the room fill with smoke, and presently found
that its walls were cracking. On this they sent forth all the
women in their company&mdash;among whom was the wife of
Falkes&mdash;together with Henry de Braybroke and the other
prisoners, escorted by some of their own number charged with
an offer of surrender. These messengers were put in chains
and kept by the King as pledges for the good faith of their
comrades, who were suffered to spend the night in the
crumbling tower after hoisting the royal standard on its
summit. Next morning <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">15 Aug.</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> all the survivors of the desperate
band were brought before the King.<a name="Anchor_1100" id="Anchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1100.">[1100]</a> One of them was the
chaplain of the castle; he was handed over to the Archbishop
to be judged according to Church law.<a name="Anchor_1101" id="Anchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1101.">[1101]</a> Most of the others,
knights and men-at-arms, were grievously wounded.<a name="Anchor_1102" id="Anchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1102.">[1102]</a> The
King remitted them to the bishops for absolution; when they
had received it,<a name="Anchor_1103" id="Anchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1103.">[1103]</a> he kept his vow; he sent them all to the
gallows. For three of them some of the nobles interceded,
and though “to save the King’s oath” these three were hanged
with the rest, they were cut down immediately, and delivered
to the Templars, on condition of joining that Order in Holy
Land.<a name="Anchor_1104" id="Anchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1104.">[1104]</a></p>

<p>When these things were done, the Bishop of Carlisle and
one of the judges, Martin of Pateshull, were sent to Falkes
with the tidings, and with an invitation or citation from the
Archbishop to present himself at Bedford for absolution.<a name="Anchor_1105" id="Anchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1105.">[1105]</a>
He swooned with horror at the unexpected fate of his brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
and his friends<a name="Anchor_1106" id="Anchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1106.">[1106]</a>&mdash;a fate from which he, like them, had hoped
that they would be saved by his vow of crusade and their
appeal to the Pope. On coming to himself he was at first
reluctant to accede to the Archbishop’s summons, being still
set on prosecuting his appeal to Rome, and also fearing the
personal enmity on the part of Stephen and Hubert of which
he believed himself to be the object; at last, however, he
consented to go,<a name="Anchor_1107" id="Anchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1107.">[1107]</a> but entreated the Bishop of Coventry to
accompany and protect him.<a name="Anchor_1108" id="Anchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1108.">[1108]</a> Thus escorted, he went to
Bedford, fell at the King’s feet and threw himself on his
mercy.<a name="Anchor_1109" id="Anchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1109.">[1109]</a> Henry committed him to the custody of Bishop
Eustace of London till his fate should be judicially determined;<a name="Anchor_1110" id="Anchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1110.">[1110]</a>
for that purpose a council was appointed to meet in London
fifteen days after Michaelmas (14th October). The few
followers who accompanied him were then absolved, but it
seems to have been deemed more prudent to defer the
absolution of Falkes himself till he had surrendered, or at
least given security for surrendering, the two castles which
he still held&mdash;Plympton and Stoke Courcy<a name="Anchor_1111" id="Anchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1111.">[1111]</a>&mdash;and all his
other property,<a name="Anchor_1112" id="Anchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1112.">[1112]</a> and also to make it as public as possible, in
order that, as the absolution of an excommunicate person
was an extremely humiliating ceremony for the penitent, it
might serve as a salutary warning to other possible rebels.
Accordingly, when Falkes had sworn to submit himself to
this humiliation on 25th August in London, a safe-conduct
was given him, on 19th August, to go thither for the twofold
purpose of receiving absolution and paying into the treasury,
as compensation for the damage and losses incurred by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
King in the siege of Bedford, the money which he had stored
at Westminster.<a name="Anchor_1113" id="Anchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1113.">[1113]</a> On the appointed day<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>25 Aug.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>, in presence of a
great concourse of people, the Archbishop had him stripped
according to the rule of the Church and then gave him
absolution.<a name="Anchor_1114" id="Anchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1114.">[1114]</a> He then executed a deed whereby he surrendered
to the Crown all his possessions of every kind, and consented
to fall under excommunication again if his constables at
Plympton and Stoke Courcy failed to give up those two
castles within a fortnight.<a name="Anchor_1115" id="Anchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1115.">[1115]</a></p>

<p>A woman struck the next blow at the fallen man. Margaret
his wife came before the King and the Archbishop and
declared that she had never consented to her marriage with
him, but had been taken by force in time of war and wedded
to him against her will, wherefore she prayed that the marriage
might be annulled. A day was set for the Archbishop to
pronounce, after due consideration, his judgement on the
matter.<a name="Anchor_1116" id="Anchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1116.">[1116]</a> Margaret’s story of the marriage may very likely
have been true; but her protest was made too late to deserve
a hearing. Even in 1215 the widow of Baldwin de Rivers
was no mere child, for she was already a mother. If the
disturbed state of public affairs and the absence of the
Primate prevented her seeking legal redress during the next
two years, she could certainly have brought her claim before
Stephen at any moment after his return in the spring of 1218.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
Instead of doing so, she waited till the man whose prosperous
fortunes she had shared for nine years, and by whom she had
at least one child,<a name="Anchor_1117" id="Anchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1117.">[1117]</a> was brought down to the dust, and then
she, too, sought to be rid of him. Such an abuse of the laws
of marriage as she petitioned for was not likely to be sanctioned
by Stephen de Langton, however sternly he might,
for the public weal, deem it necessary to deal with her
husband. His judgement on her petition is not recorded;
but there are clear indications that it was given against
her.<a name="Anchor_1118" id="Anchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1118.">[1118]</a></p>

<p>For more than nine weeks Falkes was kept, strictly
guarded, in the custody of the Bishop of London. The
meeting of the Council which was to decide his fate had been
fixed for 14th October, but no decision seems to have been
reached till about the 26th.<a name="Anchor_1119" id="Anchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1119.">[1119]</a> <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">Oct.</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> Moved partly by remonstrances
which the Pope had, some months before, addressed both to
the King and to the Primate in behalf of Falkes,<a name="Anchor_1120" id="Anchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1120.">[1120]</a> partly by
their own undeniable knowledge of Falkes’s long and faithful
service to the King’s father, the Council unanimously determined
that he should be spared in life and limbs, on condition
that he would abjure the realm and go over sea on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
pilgrimage, never to return.<a name="Anchor_1121" id="Anchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1121.">[1121]</a> The Primate exacted from
him a further promise not to carry his complaints to the Pope.<a name="Anchor_1122" id="Anchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1122.">[1122]</a>
To these conditions he submitted. On 26th October he
received a safe-conduct to go to the coast and remain there
till he could get across the sea,<a name="Anchor_1123" id="Anchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1123.">[1123]</a> and orders for the manning
of the ship which was to carry him were issued to William de
Breuse and the Earl of Warren,<a name="Anchor_1124" id="Anchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1124.">[1124]</a> the latter of whom was commissioned
to see him safely on board. It was reported that
when parting from the Earl, Falkes with tears begged him to
carry his greetings to “his lord the King,” declaring with a
solemn oath that his disturbances of England’s peace had been
instigated by “the great men of the land.” Five of his men-at-arms
accompanied him to Normandy.<a name="Anchor_1125" id="Anchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1125.">[1125]</a> So far was Louis

into shape (or at least into Latin) the “Complaint” which&mdash;in
defiance of his promise to Archbishop Stephen&mdash;he presented
to the Pope. In August he was captured in Burgundy
by a knight called Anselm “de Duime,” whom he had
once made prisoner and put to heavy ransom in England.
The Pope seems to have procured his release,<a name="Anchor_1130" id="Anchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1130.">[1130]</a> on which he
returned to France, and dwelt for a year at Troyes; at last he
was driven out of the country because he refused to do homage
to Louis. Returning to Rome, he once more entreated the
Pope to insist that he should be restored at least to the enjoyment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
of his wife’s society and of the proceeds of her patrimony.<a name="Anchor_1131" id="Anchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1131.">[1131]</a>
Honorius wrote accordingly, both to the King and to Archbishop
Stephen.<a name="Anchor_1132" id="Anchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1132.">[1132]</a> Soon afterwards, however, the whole
matter was ended by the death of Falkes.<a name="Anchor_1133" id="Anchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1133.">[1133]</a> A year later <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1226</span><span class="sn_para">}</span>
Henry was trying&mdash;with what success we know not&mdash;to
reclaim from the Master of the Temple in London eleven
thousand marks which Falkes on his death-bed was said
to have confessed were still in the head house of the Order
in England, where he had deposited them for secrecy and
safety.<a name="Anchor_1134" id="Anchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1134.">[1134]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1224</div>

<p>Having crushed Falkes, King and ministers in the autumn
of 1224 at last found leisure for taking measures of defence
and defiance against the greater foe beyond the sea. Special
bailiffs were appointed for the protection of the coasts.<a name="Anchor_1135" id="Anchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1135.">[1135]</a>
Reinforcements were sent to the Channel Isles to hold them
against a possible attack from France.<a name="Anchor_1136" id="Anchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1136.">[1136]</a> The bailiffs of some of
the great trading towns were ordered to seize the persons, goods,
and chattels of all Normans and other subjects of the French
King within their several bailiwicks.<a name="Anchor_1137" id="Anchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1137.">[1137]</a> Soon, however, it
became apparent that Louis had no present intention of
attacking England, but was bent on completing his conquest
of Aquitaine, and that Gascony was in imminent danger of
falling into his hands like Poitou. The English King’s great
difficulty was, as usual, the want of money. Before the host
broke up after the siege of Bedford the carucage granted by
the prelates had been supplemented by a like grant from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
barons;<a name="Anchor_1138" id="Anchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1138.">[1138]</a> this was followed by a scutage,<a name="Anchor_1139" id="Anchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1139.">[1139]</a> and in November a
tallage was laid on the Jews.<a name="Anchor_1140" id="Anchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1140.">[1140]</a> But all this was insufficient;
and at the Christmas court at Westminster Hubert appealed
to all present for “counsel and aid whereby the Crown of
England might recover its lost dignities and its ancient rights
in the parts beyond the sea,” and added that he “thought this
could be done if a fifteenth part of all moveable goods
throughout England were given to the King by both clergy
and laity.” After some deliberation the whole assembly
agreed to adopt this suggestion, “if the King would grant them
their long desired liberties”<a name="Anchor_1141" id="Anchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1141.">[1141]</a>&mdash;that is, if he would re-issue
and confirm the Great Charter. The King’s feeling about
this matter seems to have remained the same as it had been
twelve months before, for it was not till 11th February (1225)<span class="sn_extra"><i>1225</i></span>
that he complied with the required condition; and then he
issued both the Charter of Liberties and that of the Forest
in a new form. The text of both Charters as he now granted
them was the same as in the issue of November, 1217. But in
the preamble to each of them he stated, not, as had been done
in all former issues (including the original Great Charter of
1215), that the liberties were granted “by the advice of his
counsellors,” but that they were granted “of his own free goodwill,
to the prelates, magnates, and all the people of England,
to be kept in the realm of England for ever”; he put on record
the grant of a fifteenth of moveables made to him in return for
this “concession and donation” on his part; and he concluded
with a solemn promise that neither he nor his heirs would do
anything to invalidate or infringe the liberties thus guaranteed,
and that any attempt to do so should be null and void. The
Primate, eleven bishops, twenty abbots, Hubert as Justiciar,
nine earls, and twenty-three barons appended their names as
witnesses.<a name="Anchor_1142" id="Anchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1142.">[1142]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1225</div>

<p>For many months King and Justiciar were occupied chiefly
with schemes, military and diplomatic, for the preservation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
what remained of Henry’s continental dominions and the
recovery of what had been lost. During the last few months
of 1224<span class="sn_extra"><i>1224</i></span> the joint efforts of Hugh of La Marche and the new
French seneschal of Poitou to win Gascony for Louis met
with considerable success. Several of the chief Gascon towns&mdash;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Emilion, Bazas, La Réole&mdash;and many of the nobles,
swore fealty to the French King.<a name="Anchor_1143" id="Anchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1143.">[1143]</a> The one man who might
still have headed an organized effort to stem the tide was
Savaric de Mauléon; but Savaric had lost the confidence of the
English government, owing to the surrender of La Rochelle.
In after days, as has been seen, he was acknowledged by
Hubert de Burgh to have been blameless in that matter; but
at the time Hubert and Henry were only too ready to lay
the blame of it at any door except the one where it was
mainly due&mdash;their own&mdash;and Savaric’s defence of his conduct
failed to convince them of his loyalty. The natural result
followed: the services which they rejected were transferred to
Henry’s rival;<a name="Anchor_1144" id="Anchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1144.">[1144]</a> and for several years to come Savaric’s talents
and energies&mdash;both of which were of a high order&mdash;were
actively employed in the office of governor of La Rochelle
and warden of the seaboard for Louis. The remnant of
Henry’s Aquitanian possessions was thus left without a
governor or head of any kind. Gascony, however, could not
be irretrievably lost so long as the great merchant sea-port of
the South, Bordeaux, remained loyal; and the citizens of
Bordeaux, whose commercial and political interests were
closely bound up with those of England, stedfastly resisted
all Hugh of Lusignan’s endeavours to cajole or frighten them
into submission. Their obstinate refusal to make even a
truce with him compelled him to retire into his own county
in October, 1224, when one of Henry’s agents in Gascony
reported their jubilant boast that they “would soon confound
all the King’s enemies, if only they had money”; “and,” he
added, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>“I believe they would, if they had with them the King
himself or his brother Richard. Wherefore I counsel that if
money be sent to them, Richard be sent likewise, with some
good man to control the expenditure of the money.”<a name="Anchor_1145" id="Anchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1145.">[1145]</a></p>

<p>This counsel was followed. The feast of the Epiphany,
1225, was Richard’s sixteenth birthday. On Candlemas day
he was knighted by his royal brother.<a name="Anchor_1146" id="Anchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1146.">[1146]</a> A fortnight later <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">13 Feb.</span><span class="sn_para">}</span>
Henry granted him the Earldom of Cornwall “with all that
pertained to the King in that county, to support himself in
the King’s service, during the King’s pleasure”;<a name="Anchor_1147" id="Anchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1147.">[1147]</a> and also, it
seems, the title of Count of Poitou, by which Richard was
thenceforth called.<a name="Anchor_1148" id="Anchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1148.">[1148]</a> Ever since the beginning of January
a fleet had been gathering to convoy the young Count over
sea;<a name="Anchor_1149" id="Anchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1149.">[1149]</a> and on Palm Sunday, 23rd March, he sailed from Portsmouth
with a small force of knights, and accompanied by his
uncle Earl William of Salisbury, Philip d’Aubigné,<a name="Anchor_1150" id="Anchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1150.">[1150]</a> and
some other chosen counsellors, all of whom were, together
with Richard himself, commissioned by the King to undertake
the “defence of Poitou and Gascony.”<a name="Anchor_1151" id="Anchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1151.">[1151]</a> They were warmly
welcomed at Bordeaux; and by the beginning of May the
King’s authority was fairly well re-established throughout
Gascony, except at Bergerac and La Réole, whose citadels
were garrisoned by Louis.<a name="Anchor_1152" id="Anchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1152.">[1152]</a></p>

<p>The Pope was anxious for peace between the two Kings,
because he wanted Louis to devote himself to the suppression
of the Albigensian disorders in the county of Toulouse and
its dependencies. A legate, Cardinal Romanus, went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
France to confer with Louis on these matters, and between
the end of May and the middle of October three embassies
were sent from England at his request to treat with Louis for
peace or a truce.<a name="Anchor_1153" id="Anchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1153.">[1153]</a> On the English side these negotiations
seem to have been undertaken without any real desire to bring
them to a successful issue; but they served the double purpose
of conciliating the Pope and gaining time to prepare for a
more vigorous prosecution of the war. Meanwhile Henry
was seeking to form alliances which might help to weaken the
power of France. At the close of the previous year it was
believed in England that Louis had on foot a project for
marrying his daughter to the young King of the Romans,
Henry, son of the Emperor Frederic <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> This the English
King endeavoured to foil by despatching to Germany an
embassy charged with proposals for two marriages, one
between his sister Isabel and the Emperor’s heir, the other
between himself and a daughter of the Duke of Austria.
The negotiations dragged on for some months,<a name="Anchor_1154" id="Anchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1154.">[1154]</a> but came to
nothing; neither, however, did the French scheme, if such a
scheme had ever really existed, for at the end of 1225 Henry
of Germany wedded Margaret of Austria. Ten years later
Isabel of England was to become the third wife of his father
the Emperor.<a name="Anchor_1155" id="Anchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1155.">[1155]</a> In the middle of August Henry of England
secretly made overtures to the deadliest enemy of both France
and Rome&mdash;Count Raymond of Toulouse<a name="Anchor_1156" id="Anchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1156.">[1156]</a>&mdash;and a draft treaty
of offensive and defensive alliance against Louis was sent from
England and its terms sworn to in Henry’s name by the
envoys who carried it to Raymond.<a name="Anchor_1157" id="Anchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1157.">[1157]</a> With another great
southern house, that of Auvergne and Clermont, whose loyalty
to France was generally doubtful, Count Richard and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
counsellors made a “confederation” which Henry ratified on
12th October, the same day on which he bade his brother and
uncle make a truce with France, and himself despatched an
embassy thither.<a name="Anchor_1158" id="Anchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1158.">[1158]</a></p>

<p>A month later, the surrender of La Réole completed the
re-establishment of Henry’s power in Gascony.<a name="Anchor_1159" id="Anchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1159.">[1159]</a> On this
Earl William of Salisbury, whose health was failing, set out
by his royal nephew’s desire for England. The ship in which
he sailed was tossed about in the Bay of Biscay “many nights
and days,” till he despaired of life and flung his jewels, money,
and fine clothes into the sea, “that as he came naked into
this world, so he might, stripped of all earthly honour, enter
into the eternal country”; and his companions followed his
example. At last they sighted the Isle of Rhé, landed there
by means of their boats, and found shelter in an abbey. But
two men-at-arms in the service of Savaric de Mauléon, who
was keeping vigilant watch on the Poitevin coast in the
interest of Louis, recognized the Earl and warned him that
he would be captured unless he left the Isle at once. He
gave the men twenty pounds, took to the ship again, and was
in perils in the sea for three weeks longer before he reached
the English coast, seemingly just after Christmas.<a name="Anchor_1160" id="Anchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1160.">[1160]</a> <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1225–1226</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> In
England he had been so completely given up for lost that
Hubert de Burgh had planned to secure the hand and the
estates of Countess Ela for a nephew of his own, Raymond
by name, and had actually persuaded the King to consent to
the marriage. Henry, however, made his consent conditional
on that of Ela herself; and when the Justiciar sent his
nephew to her “in noble knightly array,” the wife of Longsword
indignantly told him that she had lately had news from
her husband stating that he was safe and well, but even if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
were dead, she would in no wise accept him (the suitor) for
her spouse, inasmuch as the nobility of her birth forbade such
a thing. “Go,” she added, “and seek a match elsewhere;
you will find by experience that you have come here in vain.”<a name="Anchor_1161" id="Anchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1161.">[1161]</a>
William, when he reached home and heard this story<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>1226<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>, went to
the King at Marlborough and after being received by him
“with great joy,” laid before him a grave complaint against
the Justiciar for having sent “some low-born fellow” to insult
the Countess; and he added that unless the King made the
Justiciar render him full satisfaction, he would seek vengeance
for such an outrage himself, in a way which would cause a
grave disturbance of the realm. The Justiciar, well knowing
that Earl William would have no difficulty in executing his
threat, at once made a humble apology and “recovered the
Earl’s favour by large gifts of valuable horses and other
things.”<a name="Anchor_1162" id="Anchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1162.">[1162]</a> The whole story is a curious illustration of the
social relations between Hubert and the great nobles of the
land; for there is no sign of any previous friction between
Hubert and Longsword in political affairs; and between the
Earl and his royal nephew there seems to have existed a
genuine personal attachment. The meeting at Marlborough
was their last; Earl William died at Salisbury on 7th March.<a name="Anchor_1163" id="Anchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1163.">[1163]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1226</div>

<p>The practical direction of affairs in Gascony and the guardianship
of its nominal ruler, young Richard, thus devolved entirely
upon Philip d’Aubigné. He was quite equal to his task, and
was moreover well supported by the English government; for
Henry and Hubert had at last learned that Gascony could not
be preserved, much less Poitou recovered, without constant
supplies of money, arms, and men<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>1225 Aug.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>; and these they continued
to pour into Bordeaux for Richard<a name="Anchor_1164" id="Anchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1164.">[1164]</a> <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">1226 Feb.–May</span><span class="sn_para">}</span>&mdash;not without considerable
difficulty and risk, for Savaric and his men were continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
cruising about, on the watch to intercept English vessels, and
doing their utmost to make all transit between England and
Aquitaine dangerous and sometimes almost impracticable.<a name="Anchor_1165" id="Anchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1165.">[1165]</a>
In January, 1226, Henry for a moment at least contemplated
going in person to join his brother.<a name="Anchor_1166" id="Anchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1166.">[1166]</a> The King was at that
moment just recovering from an illness which for a time had
endangered his life;<a name="Anchor_1167" id="Anchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1167.">[1167]</a> this fact, coinciding with Earl William’s
return and recital of his experiences at sea, may have made
Hubert and the other councillors urge the postponement of a
project involving so serious a risk; for the ship which had been
prepared for the King soon afterwards sailed without him.<a name="Anchor_1168" id="Anchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1168.">[1168]</a> At
the end of the month Louis of France took the Cross as leader
of the expedition against Toulouse.<a name="Anchor_1169" id="Anchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1169.">[1169]</a> Again the Legate
Romanus pleaded with Henry for a truce, and on 22nd March an
envoy was despatched from England to confer with him about
the matter; but the terms in which this mission was announced
shew plainly that the young King and his counsellors were
not disposed to enter upon any negotiations with Louis.<a name="Anchor_1170" id="Anchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1170.">[1170]</a>
They were in fact planning to make an attempt at the recovery
of Poitou as soon as Louis should be too busy with his crusade
to give any help or support to his Poitevin adherents.</p>

<p>The French host was summoned to meet at Bourges on
17th May.<a name="Anchor_1171" id="Anchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1171.">[1171]</a> The chief English seaports were bidden to send all
their ships to Portsmouth so as to be there on 30th May
ready to go forth “on the King’s service.”<a name="Anchor_1172" id="Anchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1172.">[1172]</a> But Henry’s
project met with an unexpected check. Louis had made it
a condition of his Albigensian crusade that the Pope should
forbid Henry, on pain of excommunication, to molest him or
his realm in any way while he was thus engaged;<a name="Anchor_1173" id="Anchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1173.">[1173]</a> and this, on
27th April, Honorius did.<a name="Anchor_1174" id="Anchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1174.">[1174]</a> When his letter reached England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
the King called his counsellors together and asked them what
they advised him to do in the face of this prohibition. They
were all of one mind that his cherished scheme must be deferred
“till it should be seen what would become of the French King,
who had undertaken such a difficult work and costly
enterprise.” Henry’s anxiety about his brother was presently
allayed by the arrival of letters from Richard giving a good
report of his successes. “Moreover there was then among the
King’s counsellors one Master William surnamed Pierepunt,
skilled in astronomy, who constantly affirmed before the King
that if the King of France proceeded with the expedition
which he had begun, he would either never return alive, or
suffer a great loss and overthrow. The King therefore,
cheered by hearing these things, acquiesced in the counsel of
his friends.”<a name="Anchor_1175" id="Anchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1175.">[1175]</a> On 23rd June the fleet was dismissed,<a name="Anchor_1176" id="Anchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1176.">[1176]</a> and so far
as Poitou was concerned, fighting and negotiation were alike
at a standstill for the next four months.</p>

<p>In Henry’s insular dominions the political storms of 1224
had been succeeded by a period of calm. The Welsh and
Irish Marches were both of them in a most unusual state of
tranquillity. Henry’s long promised and oft deferred conference
with Llywelyn about the amends due for the Welsh raid
of January, 1223, seems to have taken place at last at the end
of September, 1224,<a name="Anchor_1177" id="Anchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1177.">[1177]</a><span class="sn_extra"><i>1224</i></span> and&mdash;strangely enough&mdash;resulted in
Llywelyn’s receiving seisin of Kinnerley.<a name="Anchor_1178" id="Anchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1178.">[1178]</a> Another conference,
probably for the settlement of matters in dispute between
Llywelyn and the Marshal and between Llywelyn and Hugh
de Mortimer, was planned and postponed several times within
the next eighteen months, and seems not to have taken place
till 27th August, 1226.<a name="Anchor_1179" id="Anchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1179.">[1179]</a><span class="sn_extra"><i>1226</i></span> On that day, at Shrewsbury, Hugh
de Mortimer “and others” again, in the King’s presence,
demanded of Llywelyn the restoration of the lands which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
had taken from them. Llywelyn asked the King for another
day, and Henry gave him one at Whitchurch on 25th October.<a name="Anchor_1180" id="Anchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1180.">[1180]</a>
The result does not appear, unless it is indicated in a statement
of <cite>the Dunstable annalist</cite> that “in the same year (1226)
agreement was made between Llywelyn and William the
Marshal and the Earl of Chester.”<a name="Anchor_1181" id="Anchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1181.">[1181]</a> But from the fact that
throughout the years 1225–1227 the Welsh chroniclers make
no boast, and the English ones no complaint, of any infraction
of the peace on the part of Llywelyn or his men, we may
safely conclude that the English successes in 1223 had had
something more than a merely transitory effect.<a name="Anchor_1182" id="Anchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1182.">[1182]</a>
The Earl Marshal had landed at Waterford as chief
Justiciar in Ireland on 19th June, 1224<span class="sn_extra"><i>1224</i></span>. At the beginning of
August he sent home to the King an encouraging report of
the state of affairs in the March.<a name="Anchor_1183" id="Anchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1183.">[1183]</a> In October his hands were
strengthened for the work which he had been specially sent
to do&mdash;the subjugation of Hugh de Lacy&mdash;by the appointment
of his cousin John Marshal as bailiff of Ulster.<a name="Anchor_1184" id="Anchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1184.">[1184]</a> One by one
Hugh’s strongholds were captured; at last, in spring, 1225<span class="sn_extra"><i>1225</i></span>,
Hugh himself surrendered, and was sent by the Earl to
England as a prisoner to beg for the King’s mercy and pardon.
Henry at first would have nothing to do with him; but the
Marshal, coming over soon afterwards, pleaded for him, and,
apparently, suggested a temporary settlement which was
carried into effect<a name="Anchor_1185" id="Anchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1185.">[1185]</a> in May. Two hundred marks, to be paid
in instalments, beginning from the Easter last past, were
granted to Hugh from the royal treasury for his support
during the current year.<a name="Anchor_1186" id="Anchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1186.">[1186]</a> Walter de Lacy was given seisin of
“all his lands in Ireland and England which the King had
seized on occasion of the war with Hugh,” the Marshal being
one of his sureties for the payment of the fine.<a name="Anchor_1187" id="Anchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1187.">[1187]</a> Twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
months later the custody of all Hugh’s lands in Ireland was
committed to Walter to hold for three years, unless within
that period Hugh should by the King’s grace obtain their
restoration to himself.<a name="Anchor_1188" id="Anchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1188.">[1188]</a> Six weeks after this, on Midsummer
eve, at Winchester, the Earl Marshal resigned the Justiciarship
of Ireland into the hands of the King, and the King at once
committed it to Geoffrey de Marsh.<a name="Anchor_1189" id="Anchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1189.">[1189]</a> The transfer was to be
made on 1st August; Geoffrey was to receive a yearly salary
of five hundred and eighty pounds at the Dublin Exchequer
so long as he remained Justiciar; and his present appointment
was not to be made an occasion for requiring of
him any account relating to his former tenure of the same
office.<a name="Anchor_1190" id="Anchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1190.">[1190]</a> Since his removal from that office Geoffrey had&mdash;except
about his papers&mdash;given no trouble; in August, 1224<span class="sn_extra"><i>1224</i></span>,
his loyal attitude had been warmly commended by the
Marshal,<a name="Anchor_1191" id="Anchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1191.">[1191]</a> and in November of the same year, when the
Marshal’s presence was temporarily required in England, the
responsibility for the peace of the March during his absence
had been entrusted to Geoffrey;<a name="Anchor_1192" id="Anchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1192.">[1192]</a> but it was probably not the
Marshal’s influence that procured his re-appointment. The
first letter which the King addressed to him as Justiciar in
1226<span class="sn_extra"><i>1226</i></span>&mdash;on 30th June, when the actual transfer of the justiciarship
had not yet taken place&mdash;was an order to summon the
King of Connaught to surrender his land (forfeited, according
to Henry’s account, by its late King’s failure to render due
service to John), and in default, to take it by force and give
seisin of it to Richard de Burgh,<a name="Anchor_1193" id="Anchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1193.">[1193]</a> who was already seneschal
of Limerick and Munster, and was brother to the chief
Justiciar of England. Geoffrey, when after a visit to England
he had re-entered upon his duties as Justiciar, declared that
“all the King’s castles in Ireland were fortified against the
King, except Limerick, which was in the custody of Richard
de Burgh, who assiduously and constantly assisted him
(Geoffrey) in bringing the King’s affairs to good success.”<a name="Anchor_1194" id="Anchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1194.">[1194]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
In Geoffrey’s re-appointment at this time we may surely see
the hand of Richard’s brother Hubert.</p>

<p>The Marshal appears to have resigned of his own accord,
giving as a reason that he had vowed a pilgrimage to
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Andrew’s; and it was with the declared intention of fulfilling
his vow immediately that he parted from the King at
Winchester at Midsummer. He had, however, got no further
north than Coventry when he heard that his pilgrimage was
being represented to the King as a cloak for some evil design;
whereupon he at once wrote to Henry that he had given up
his project and resolved to go straight back to Ireland.
Henry, on 10th July, warmly protested that he had no
suspicions of his brother-in-law, but looked upon him as a
trusty and loyal counsellor and friend. “But,” he added, “if
you really intend to give up your journey and cross over to
Ireland, we bid you first come to us and surrender our castles
of Caermarthen and Cardigan; or, if you cannot possibly
come, send us a man of yours with power to do so. We
are going towards York on business, and propose thence to
return to the marches of Wales.”<a name="Anchor_1195" id="Anchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1195.">[1195]</a> This surrender was duly
made before 18th August, when the King committed Caermarthen
and Cardigan to Henry of Audley, by a letter-patent
in which he expressly declared that the Marshal was to be
quit for the whole of the time during which these two castles
had been in his keeping and in that of his father before him.<a name="Anchor_1196" id="Anchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1196.">[1196]</a>
Probably the brothers-in-law had at their midsummer meeting
agreed upon this transfer, and also upon another arrangement
which was put into legal form a few days later. On 22nd
August the castle of Caerleon, “of which the King demanded
seisin,”<a name="Anchor_1197" id="Anchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1197.">[1197]</a> was committed to him by the Earl Marshal “saving
his own right and his inheritance” therein; and on the 26th
the King “committed the castle to the Marshal, to hold for
four years from the ensuing Michaelmas day.” At the end of
the four years the Marshal was to deliver the castle to the
King, “saving his own right”; and the King, within a month
after he had received it, was to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>“cause the Earl to have judgement
of his peers of such right and seisin as he had on the
day when this convention was made at Hereford, and of
any other right which he might be able in the meanwhile to
search out”; such right not to be prejudiced by the present
convention. If the Earl’s peers should adjudge seisin to him,
he was to have it without delay, “saving the rights of each
party”; and the judgement was not to be delayed beyond the
appointed term. Finally, “through this convention the King’s
anger&mdash;if he had any&mdash;against the Earl and his men shall be
left behind.”<a name="Anchor_1198" id="Anchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1198.">[1198]</a> On the day after this convention was made
public, it was announced that the Marshal “had set out for
Ireland in the King’s service.”<a name="Anchor_1199" id="Anchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1199.">[1199]</a> This was shortly after
Geoffrey de Marsh had been complaining that when he called
upon the barons of the March to renew their homage to the
King, those of Leinster failed to respond, and one of them,
Theobald Butler, flatly refused to recognize the new Justiciar’s
authority without instructions from the Earl Marshal.<a name="Anchor_1200" id="Anchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1200.">[1200]</a> We
can scarcely help suspecting that all these things were
connected; that the Marshal’s successes in Wales and Ireland,
and his marriage with the King’s sister, had aroused the
jealousy of the De Burghs, and that Geoffrey was an instrument
in their hands. If so, they were playing a game which
might have proved dangerous both to themselves and to their
sovereign, had it not been for the dignified moderation and
stedfast loyalty of the Earl. However this may be, Geoffrey
de Marsh remained Justiciar in Ireland till he resigned the
office of his own accord in February, 1228.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1225</div>

<p>In England itself the only problem which seems to have
given serious trouble to the government during these years
was the everlasting problem of finance. Gascony had to be
supplied, and to supply Gascony the English treasury had to
be drained till there was nothing left for the needs of the
English State and of the Crown itself. Five days after the
re-issue of the Charters in 1225&mdash;on 16th February&mdash;orders
were given for their publication throughout the realm;<a name="Anchor_1201" id="Anchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1201.">[1201]</a> the
writs concerning the fifteenth had been issued on the previous
day. Half of the tax was to be paid into the treasury at
Trinity, the other half at Michaelmas. Detailed instructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
were given as to the mode of assessment, the incidence of the
tax, the manner of collection;<a name="Anchor_1202" id="Anchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1202.">[1202]</a> nevertheless, before the end
of March the commissioners employed about the matter in
one county at least found themselves involved in unexpected
difficulties. From the wording of the royal order it appeared
(at any rate to them) that the free tenants of bishops and
abbots were to be assessed like those of lay lords; but in
Kent the Archbishop forbade the assessment of any such
tenants except those holding by military service. On 29th
March the King sanctioned this limitation. Complaints had
also reached him that the commissioners were “compelling
poor women who had only a small quantity of thread, or a
brooch worth two or three pence, to give a fifteenth”; this
practice they were bidden to stop at once, lest the curses of
the poor should fall upon the head of the King. On the
other hand, he bade them “diligently and efficaciously induce
all crusaders” (who as such were legally exempt) “to contribute
to this fifteenth, which is appointed for the peace and
safety of our land and the common weal and defence of all;
and tell them plainly and openly they are to know that as
many of them as shall hold back from giving us this fifteenth,
they and their heirs will never have any part in the liberties
which we have granted to our loyal subjects by our Charters.”<a name="Anchor_1203" id="Anchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1203.">[1203]</a>
This method of persuasion, however tyrannical it may sound,
was perfectly logical. The Charters had avowedly been
renewed for a consideration; those who withheld their share of
that consideration, although able to pay it, were not entitled
to a share in the benefit of the Charters. The irretrievable
blunder which the Great Council had committed at Christmas,
1224, in making a bargain with the Crown for a renewal of
the Charters, was already bringing forth its fruit.</p>

<p>Archbishop Stephen’s prohibition to the commissioners in
Kent was probably dictated by caution; certainly not by
unwillingness to help in supplying the needs of the Crown.
The Pope, on 3rd February, wrote to the English prelates and
clergy exhorting them to make collections in their several
dioceses for the King, but to take care that the proceeds went
“for useful and necessary purposes,” not in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>“superfluous and
vain expenses,” and that this collection should not be made
a precedent.<a name="Anchor_1204" id="Anchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1204.">[1204]</a> When this letter reached England Stephen
bade his suffragans urge their clergy to obey it by contributing
an aid out of such of their property as was exempt from the
fifteenth, and also to pay up their share of that tax, but to
take care that whatever money they gave was kept safe till
further orders.<a name="Anchor_1205" id="Anchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1205.">[1205]</a> Their compliance with these exhortations
was made none the easier by the arrival, just before Christmas,
of a papal messenger, Master Otto, and his presence in
England during the next four months. The expenses which
fell upon persons who went on business to the Roman Court
were a subject of general complaint; Honorius proposed that
this should be remedied by the reservation of a prebend in
every cathedral and collegiate church, and a certain proportion
of the revenue of every bishop and every religious house in all
the realms of Latin Christendom, for the Apostolic See, so
that the Pope and the officers of his court might have sufficient
means to dispense with the need of charging such heavy fees.<a name="Anchor_1206" id="Anchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1206.">[1206]</a>
A council assembled at Bourges on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Andrew’s day<a name="Anchor_1207" id="Anchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1207.">[1207]</a> opposed
this project so strongly that Cardinal Romanus decided to
urge it no further in France till it should be accepted in
the Empire, England, and Spain.<a name="Anchor_1208" id="Anchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1208.">[1208]</a> In England, whither the
Pope’s demand was carried by Otto, the need of consulting
all the estates of the realm, and the King’s illness in January,
1226<span class="sn_extra"><i>1226</i></span>, served as reasons or excuses for deferring a decision till
the middle of April. Then, according to one account, the
King and the prelates followed the cautious example of their
French brethren, saying they would wait to see how other
countries would deal with the question; or, according to
another authority, they answered that in any case England
ought to be free from such an exaction, by reason of her
annual tribute to the Pope.<a name="Anchor_1209" id="Anchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1209.">[1209]</a> But that tribute was
heavily in arrear, and obviously it was not to be expected
that either Otto or Honorius would be satisfied till the arrears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
were paid up. This, therefore, had to be done, and a sum of
over fifteen hundred marks went with Otto back to Rome.<a name="Anchor_1210" id="Anchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1210.">[1210]</a>
All this while Otto’s long stay had been adding to the
financial burdens of the English clergy, for a papal envoy was
entitled to claim from every cathedral and collegiate church
procurations to the amount of forty shillings; although Otto
seems to have contented himself with a smaller sum.<a name="Anchor_1211" id="Anchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1211.">[1211]</a> In
October <span class="sn_para"> {</span><span class="sn_date">13 Oct.</span><span class="sn_para">}</span> the clergy made their grant to the Crown; it consisted
of a sixteenth of the annual income of their benefices.<a name="Anchor_1212" id="Anchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1212.">[1212]</a>
Meanwhile Henry was chafing under the Papal command
to refrain from war in France while Louis was on crusade.
Again he sought to form alliances among the neighbours and
the disaffected feudatories of the French King; in April he
was negotiating with the Duke of Lorraine,<a name="Anchor_1213" id="Anchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1213.">[1213]</a> in October he
was making plans&mdash;which however came to nothing&mdash;to
marry the daughter of the Duke of Britanny.<a name="Anchor_1214" id="Anchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1214.">[1214]</a> Suddenly the
political situation in France changed. On 8th November
Master William Pierepunt’s forecast came true; Louis of
France died at Montpensier in Auvergne.<a name="Anchor_1215" id="Anchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1215.">[1215]</a> His successor
was a boy ten years old. Neither the late King nor his
father, Philip Augustus, had been liked by the barons, and
many of these seized the occasion to assail the Queen-mother,
Blanche of Castille, with demands for the restitution of
sundry liberties of which, they said, Louis <abbr title="8">VIII</abbr> and Philip
had deprived them.<a name="Anchor_1216" id="Anchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1216.">[1216]</a> The coronation, on 30th November,
was almost if not quite as scantily attended as the first
crowning of Henry had been.<a name="Anchor_1217" id="Anchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1217.">[1217]</a> Henry at once despatched
the Archbishop of York, Philip d’Aubigné, and some other
envoys, to the chief nobles of Normandy, Anjou, and Poitou,
and to the Duke of Britanny&mdash;all lands which, from his point
of view, ought rightfully to be subject to himself&mdash;announcing
his intention of going over sea, and calling upon them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
receive him loyally.<a name="Anchor_1218" id="Anchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1218.">[1218]</a> On 18th December elaborate schemes
of concessions to Hugh and Isabel, and also to Hugh of
Thouars<a name="Anchor_1219" id="Anchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1219.">[1219]</a> and William Larchevêque, were drawn up, witnessed,

Perhaps they were deemed needless owing to a piece of news
which may have arrived from Aquitaine: Savaric de Mauléon
had on the death of Louis <abbr title="8">VIII</abbr> reverted to his old allegiance,
and opened the gates of La Rochelle to Richard.<a name="Anchor_1221" id="Anchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1221.">[1221]</a> Henry,
however, was not ready for immediate action on a great
scale; and at Mid-Lent (18th March), 1227<span class="sn_extra"><i>1227</i></span>, a truce was
made between Richard of Poitou on the one part, and Louis
IX, Blanche, Hugh of Lusignan, and their adherents on the
other, to last till a fortnight after Midsummer.<a name="Anchor_1222" id="Anchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1222.">[1222]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1227</div>

<p>The English court had spent the Christmas of 1226 at
Reading<a name="Anchor_1223" id="Anchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1223.">[1223]</a> and thence moved on by way of Wallingford to
Oxford.<a name="Anchor_1224" id="Anchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1224.">[1224]</a> What took place there, before the festal gathering
usual at the season broke up, is related by the King himself
in a circular letter issued on the 21st January, 1227, to all the
sheriffs of England: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>“Be it known to you that by the common
counsel of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the bishops, abbots,
earls, barons, and other our magnates and faithful men, we
recently at Oxford provided that henceforth we will cause
charters and confirmations to be made under our seal. And we
therefore bid you without delay publicly proclaim and make
known to all persons in your bailiwick who have, or claim to
have, lands or tenements or liberties by grant or concession and
confirmation of our ancestors the Kings of England, or by our
precept, that they come to us without fail before the beginning
of this approaching Lent of the eleventh year of our reign, to
shew us by what warrant they have, or claim to have, those lands
or tenements or liberties, as they desire to keep or to recover
them. You are also to make known to all persons in your
bailiwick, and cause to be publicly proclaimed, that whosoever
shall desire to obtain at any time our charter or confirmation
of lands, tenements, markets, liberties, or anything whatsoever,
let them come to us before the same term, to ask for our
charter or confirmation thereof.”<a name="Anchor_1225" id="Anchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1225.">[1225]</a> Thus in the second week
of January, 1227<span class="sn_date"><i><span class="sn_para"> {</span>8–10 Jan.<span class="sn_para">}</span></i></span>, three months after the completion of Henry’s
nineteenth year, the Great Council of the realm sanctioned his
release from the one restriction which in 1223 the same
authority had decided should still remain imposed for a while
upon his exercise of regal power. In what manner and on
whose initiative this step was taken we do not know. The
only chronicler who even professes to give any account of the
matter asserts that Henry “declared before all” the Council
“that he was of legal age, and henceforth, being set free from
wardship, would order the affairs of the Crown as a prince”;
and that the announcement about charters caused a great
commotion, for which the Justiciar was universally held
responsible, as the instigator of the King’s action.<a name="Anchor_1226" id="Anchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1226.">[1226]</a> But this
writer’s account of that action, and of its accompanying
circumstances, is too full of demonstrable confusions and
inaccuracies to be worthy of confidence in any particular.<a name="Anchor_1227" id="Anchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1227.">[1227]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
The suggestion may very likely have come from Hubert; but
we need not accept for truth the insinuation which Hubert’s
enemies seem to have induced Henry to believe at a later
time, that Hubert was actuated mainly by a desire to secure
for himself a grant in perpetuity from the Crown.<a name="Anchor_1228" id="Anchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1228.">[1228]</a> Nor was
there in the King’s proposed action any thing from which
the other members of the Council could fairly withhold their
consent. At the close of a long minority following on a period
of confusion and civil war, it was not unreasonable&mdash;at any
rate according to the ideas of that age&mdash;that there should be
a general scrutiny of title-deeds which emanated or purported
to emanate from the Crown, with a view to ascertaining their
genuineness and validity, and thus safeguarding the rights
both of the grantees and of the King. Whatever had been
granted since Henry’s accession had been granted by a royal
“precept,” not by charter; if such a grant was to be made
permanent a charter would be necessary to make it so; and
the letter of 21st January, fairly construed, implies no design of
invalidating any earlier grants except such as should on
examination prove to be inherently void. But the practice
of seeking from the reigning sovereign confirmation of grants
made by his predecessors was, and had been for centuries, so
common that the King’s comprehensive invitation to “all who
desired his confirmation of anything whatsoever” was certain
to meet with an almost equally comprehensive response. On
the other hand, every one knew that such grants always had
to be paid for. In this latter circumstance may be seen the
reason why Henry and his ministers were now so anxious to
ante-date his full majority. The young King’s heart was set
upon a great expedition over sea; the war-chest was empty;<a name="Anchor_1229" id="Anchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1229.">[1229]</a>
the payments for confirmations of royal grants would
substantially&mdash;perhaps more substantially than any other
scheme that could have been devised&mdash;help to fill it.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether the far-off guardian who for ten
years had watched over the interests of John Lackland’s heir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
and of his realm ever knew of his ward’s self-emancipation;
for Honorius <abbr title="the Third">III</abbr> died on 18th March, 1227. Some years
later a transcript of one of the letters by which he had
sanctioned Henry’s coming of age in 1223 appears to have
been prepared by Bishops Peter of Winchester and Hugh of
Ely for transmission to his successor Gregory IX;<a name="Anchor_1230" id="Anchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1230.">[1230]</a> whether in
consequence of some inquiry addressed to them by Gregory
on the subject, we cannot tell. The authorizations given by
Honorius were wide enough to cover the proceedings of
January, 1227, without any need of further ratification from
Rome. If those proceedings did reach the ears of the dying
Pontiff, he may well have rejoiced to know that he would not
have to leave his task of guardianship unfinished, and that
this part of his burden of responsibility and care would not
pass to the next Pope. Henceforth Henry of England must
indeed be accounted as of full age, and answerable for himself
and his realm.</p>

The only authority for this demand for a confirmation of the Charter, <cite>Roger
of Wendover</cite>, places it in 1223. Its true date, however, seems to be 1224.
Roger says it took place “in London, on the octave of Epiphany,” <i>i.e.</i> on
13th January. But in 1223 the court, which had kept Christmas at Oxford (as he
says), and thence gone into Wiltshire, Dorset, and Hampshire, did not return to
London till 20th or 21st January (<cite id="Footnote_963a"><i>Close Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 527–529</cite>). In 1224, on
the other hand, the King was at Westminster from 8th January to 26th February
(<cite><i><a href="#Footnote_963a" title="Go to citation in Footnote 963.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 580&nbsp;b–586</cite>). Moreover, in January, 1223, there were, so far as can be
seen, no circumstances likely to suggest such a demand; but in January, 1224, the
suggestion would be obvious. I think that Roger has betrayed at once his own
confusion, and how he fell into it, in the words which immediately follow his
report of Henry’s reply: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et rex protinus, habito super hoc consilio, misit
literas suas ad singulos vicecomites regni, ut per milites duodecim vel legales
homines uniuscujusque comitatus per sacramentum facerent inquiri quae fuerunt
libertates in Anglia tempore regis Henrici avi sui, et factam inquisitionem apud
Londonias mitterent ad regem in quindecim diebus post Pascham</span>” (<cite><abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 84</cite>).
It is clear that the inquisition here spoken of is that ordered on 30th January,
1223 (see above, <a href="#Page_201" title="Go to page 201.">p. 201</a>), which Roger took to be an inquiry into the ancient
liberties of England, instead of (as it really was) into those of the Crown.
Thus mistaking its character, he further mistook it for a consequence of the
demand for the Charter: a demand which (as I believe) it really preceded by
nearly twelve months, and with which its connexion&mdash;so far as the two things
were connected at all&mdash;was quite the reverse of that which Roger implies; the
inquest into the royal privileges having been, in all likelihood, one of the
provocations which led the barons to ask for a confirmation of their own
rights.

have no means of judging whether it is derived from contemporary report, or is
merely the invention of some imaginative etymologist. The French form of the
name is Falkes, Faukes, or Fauques, variously Latinized as Falkesius or Falcasius,
sometimes as Falco. It seems to have been a variant of Fulk, Fouques, Fulco,

<cite><i>Close Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">ii.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 72&nbsp;b, 73</cite>. These three writs are entered on the
back of membrane 17 of the Close Roll 9 <abbr title="Henry the Third">Hen. III</abbr> (October, 1224&ndash;October, 1225),
and thus appear to belong to April&ndash;May, 1225; but this cannot be their true date;
Falkes was outlawed and out of England long before April, 1225. The scribe
has put them on a wrong roll. With the chronological data for the year 1224
they fit in perfectly. Falkes says he was accused to the King “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">triduo post
pacem</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, three days after peace was made in London between Hubert and his
opponents (<abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr> <a href="#Page_216" title="Go to pages 216, 217.">above, pp. 216, 217</a>). In 1224 the King was in London, 21st April&ndash;26th
May (<cite><i>Close Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 593&nbsp;b–601</cite>; <cite><i><abbr title="Patent">Pat.</abbr> Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 436&ndash;441</cite>).
Combining this fact with Falkes’s statement and with the writ of 26th April, we
see that the “peace” must have been made not earlier than 21st April, and
not later than the 23rd. The Monday after the octave of Trinity in that year,
17th June, was the morrow of the day fixed for the re-assembling of the Council at
Northampton; see above, <a href="#Page_222" title="Go to page 222."><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 222</a>.

of the attack on Bedford and the excommunication of Falkes, he was mistaken.
On 17th August Honorius wrote to Henry reproaching him for his neglect
of previous admonitions to treat his subjects gently, and especially for his
ingratitude to Falkes, and pointing out the inexpediency of spending on civil
war forces that were urgently needed for external defence (<cite><i><a href="#Footnote_1086a" title="Go to citation in Footnote 1086.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 544</cite>). On or
about the same date he addressed a very sharp letter to Archbishop Stephen,
reproving him for his share in the matter, and ordering him to recall the sentence
which he was reported to have passed upon Falkes and to stop the King’s action
against that personage. On the justice of that action Honorius passes no
judgement; what he insists upon is its inopportuneness (<cite><i><a href="#Footnote_1086a" title="Go to citation in Footnote 1086.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 543, 544</cite>).

The silence of the <i><abbr title="Brut y Tywysogion" lang="wlm" xml:lang="wlm">Brut</abbr></i> is most significant. That chronicle, after its daring
assertion that the Earl Marshal was “slain” at Carnwyllon in 1223 (see above, <a href="#Footnote_893" title="Go to Footnote 893.">
footnote 893</a>), says not another word about the relations between England and

Roger dates these proceedings “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mense Februario</span>,” which the letter close
shews to be a month too late; he says that Henry thereupon “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">excussit se per
consilium Huberti de Burgo, justiciarii regni, de consilio et gubernatione dicti
episcopi [Wintoniensis] et suorum, qui regi fuerant prius quasi paedagogi, ita
quod omnes illas a curia sua et cohabitatione removit</span>” (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 139), whereas Peter
had been removed from his tutorship six years before; and he travesties the
proclamation about charters as follows: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In eodem itaque concilio rex fecit
cancellare et cassare omnes chartas de provinciis omnibus regni Angliae
de libertatibus Forestae, postquam jam per biennium in toto regno fuerant
usitatae, hanc occasionem praetendens quod chartae illae concessae fuerant, et
libertates scriptae et signatae, dum ipse erat sub custodia, nec sui corporis aut
sigilli aliquam habuerit potestatem, unde viribus carere debuit quod sine ratione
fuerat usurpatum.... Tunc vero denuntiatum est viris religiosis et aliis qui
suis volebant libertatibus gaudere, ut innovarent chartas suas de novo regis sigillo,
scientes quod rex chartas antiquas nullius esse momenti reputabat</span>” (<cite><abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 139, 140</cite>).
The King’s instructions to the sheriffs say not a word of the Forest Charter, and
were obviously never meant to apply either to that document or to the Great
Charter; and what they do say about other charters is completely misrepresented
by the last clause of Roger’s concluding sentence.

<span class="ch3">THE TRUCES OF 1216–1217</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> accounts of the truces made between Henry and Louis in the
winter of 1216–1217 are so conflicting that it seems impossible either to
reconcile them or to arrive at a precise conclusion as to all the facts and
dates. The documentary evidence on the subject is unluckily very
scanty; it consists&mdash;so far as I have been able to ascertain&mdash;only of two
entries in the Patent Roll of 1. <abbr title="Henry the Third">Hen. III</abbr> (Oct. 1216&mdash;Oct. 1217). The
first of these is a notice, dated 28th December, 1216, from Henry to
Louis, concerning claims of redress for injuries done “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">infra treugas inter
nos captas</span>” (<cite id="Note_1a"><i><abbr title="Patent">Pat.</abbr> Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 107</cite>). The second is a report, addressed
by the Marshal and Council to Louis, of a meeting held “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">die Jovis in
crastino <abbr title="Sancti">S.</abbr> Petri</span>” between the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">emendatores treugae</em> on both sides, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
emendaciones capiendas et faciendas de interceptionibus factis in prima
treuga et secunda, et ad treugam faciendum observari et tenere</span>”
(<cite><i><a href="#Note_1a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 109</cite>). This letter is dateless; it is entered on the Roll between
a letter dated 28th February and one dated 10th March. “Thursday
the morrow of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter” probably means 19th January, the day after the
festival of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter’s Chair at Rome, which festival fell on a Wednesday
in 1217. The feast of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter’s Chair at Antioch, 22nd February, was also
a Wednesday in that year; but it is hardly possible that this talk about
truces could have been going on as late as 23rd February, only five days
before the “Crusaders” mustered at Dorking proclaimed their intention
of expelling Louis from Rye (see above, <a href="#Page_24" title="Go to page 24."><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 24</a>).</p>

<p>From these entries, then, it results that there were two truces, one
of which was existing on 28th December, 1216; that a second truce was
made before 19th January, 1217; and that <em>a</em> truce&mdash;either this second
truce, or a third&mdash;was existing at some date posterior to 19th January,
1217.</p>

<p>The <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="L’Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal">Hist. G. le Mar.</abbr></i></cite> states that when the garrison of Hertford
(besieged by Louis 11th November, 1216, see above, <a href="#Page_18" title="Go to page 18."><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 18</a>) became hopeless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>

Herefort; Seisis en fu, fust dreit ou tort</span>” (<cite><abbr title="lines">ll.</abbr> 15717–28</cite>); and that
“<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">Quant ceste trieve fu faillie, Cil qui aveient la baillie Autre trieve de
vint jors pristrent, Sanz le <abbr title="Mareschal">Mar.</abbr>; si mespristrent, Quer il baillerent deus
chasteals Riches e forz e buens e beals; Ce fu Norviz e Orefort</span>”
(<cite><abbr title="lines">ll.</abbr> 15735–41</cite>). <cite>The <abbr title="Chronicle of">Chron.</abbr> Merton (Petit-Dutaillis, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 514)</cite> says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hoc
anno [1216] facta fuit pax circa festum <abbr title="Sancti">S.</abbr> Andreae, quae duravit usque
ad octabas <abbr title="Sancti">S.</abbr> Hillarii, inter Lodovicum et Henricum regem Angliae</span>,”
adding a detail which may be safely ignored&mdash;that the truce was purchased
at the price of seven thousand marks paid to Louis. The
Barnwell annalist says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">[Lodowicus] applicuit castra ad castellum

mentions only one truce, which he represents as made in consequence
of the tidings received by Louis as to the Pope’s intention of
excommunicating him on Maundy Thursday: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hac itaque de causa
statutae sunt treugae inter Lodowicum et regem Henricum usque ad
mensem de Pascha, ita scilicet ut omnia remaneant in eo statu quo
fuerunt in die quo juratae fuerunt treugae, in castellis et rebus aliis,
usque ad terminum constitutum</span>” (<cite id="Note_1b"><abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 11</cite>). He has, however,
previously stated that Berkhamsted surrendered “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post diutinam
obsidionem, ex praecepto regis</span>” (<cite><i><a href="#Note_1b" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 6</cite>). These words, taken in
connexion with the Biographer’s story, suggest that that story is correct,
and that Waleran held Berkhamsted in defiance of the truce till he was
peremptorily ordered by the Council to give it up. This first truce,
then, seems to have been made not later than 6th December, the day
on which Hertford surrendered (above, <a href="#Page_18" title="Go to page 18."><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 18</a>); it may have been made,
as the Merton Chronicle asserts, a week earlier, and Walter de Godardville
may, like Waleran, have ignored it as long as he could. If it were
made on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Andrew’s day, it would&mdash;supposing the Biographer to be right
about its duration&mdash;expire on 20th December, the day on which Roger
says that Berkhamsted surrendered. The Biographer seems to imply
that the second truce commenced immediately on the expiration of the
first; and twenty days from 20th December bring us to 9th January. If,
however, the first truce began on 6th December, it would end on 26th December;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
and this would bring the termination of the second truce to
15th January. These dates agree neither with the Barnwell annalist’s
“octave of Epiphany” nor with the Merton Chronicler’s “octave of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hilary”; and what is of much more consequence, even the latest date
alleged for the expiration of the second truce&mdash;that given by the
Merton writer, 20th January&mdash;fails to account for the letter patent
which shews that there was a truce not merely unexpired, but,
seemingly, not even approaching expiration, as late as 19th January.
There seems to be no way of overcoming this difficulty except by
supposing that the second truce was followed by a third. My belief is
that this was so, and that the key to the whole puzzle about the truces
and the surrenders of castles in 1216–1217 is to be found in the words
of the Barnwell annalist. This writer appears to me to deal with the
various truces made between the end of November, 1216, and the end
of February, 1217, not singly, but in a group. His account of the
<em>treugae generales</em> up to the meeting of the rival councils at Oxford and
Cambridge includes, <em>explicitly</em>, what may be called the Biographer’s first
truce (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">reddito quod obsidebatur castello</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, Berkhamsted&mdash;and Hertford&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro
treugarum impetratione</span>” (<abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr> <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="L’Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal">Hist. G. le Mar.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="lines">ll.</abbr> 15717–28</cite>);
<em>implicitly</em>, the Biographer’s second truce (“<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">Autre trieve de vint jors</span>,”
ending <em>approximately</em> “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad octavas Epiphaniae</span>”); and <em>implicitly</em> also, I
venture to think, a <i>third</i> truce (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>durantibus adhuc treugis</em> convocaverunt
fautores suos ... tutores regii apud Oxoniam</span>,” as we know from the
Close Roll, <em>after</em> the octave of Epiphany (see above, <a href="#Page_19" title="Go to page 19."><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 19</a>). After
mentioning the two councils and the fruitless negotiations for peace,
the annalist tells us that yet <em>another</em> truce (seemingly the fourth) was
proposed; and he winds up the whole subject by giving us, <em>not</em> the
conditions or the results of that particular proposal, but a general list of
the castles&mdash;Hedingham, Orford, Norwich, Colchester&mdash;which “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tunc
temporis</span>” (<i>i.e.</i> within the last five or six weeks) had, in consideration of
the successive truces since the first, been surrendered to Louis, and
of which the undisturbed possession was now secured to him for a further
period of some two months or more, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro treugis ad mensem post
Pascha</span>.” In a word, the Barnwell writer tells that these four castles were,
at some time between the middle of December, 1216, and the middle of
February, 1217, bartered for renewals of the truce which had begun with
the surrender of Berkhamsted; but which particular castles were
bartered for which particular renewal, he leaves us to make out for ourselves.
The task is perhaps not so difficult as it looks at first glance.
The <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire des Ducs</i></cite> gives an independent list, somewhat fuller than
the Barnwell writer’s, of Louis’s gains after Hertford and Berkhamsted:
“<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">Puis prist le castiel de Colecestre e celui d’Orefort e celui d’Ingehem</span>”
[Hedingham] “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">e celui del Plasseis e Cantebruge, e moult d’autres
fortereces.... La cites de Norewis li fu rendue</span>” (<cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire des Ducs de Normandie">Hist. Ducs</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 182</cite>).
The word <em lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">prist</em> here would, if we had no other version of the story,
naturally appear to mean “took by force”; but our other evidence
shews that, with regard to Orford at least, it is in reality only equivalent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
to the phrase used by the same writer concerning Norwich, and by the
Barnwell annalist concerning not only Norwich and Orford, but also
concerning Hedingham and Colchester&mdash;“<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">li fu rendu</span>,” “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">redditum est</span>.”
We know from the Biographer that Norwich and Orford were the price
of the second truce. We know from the combined evidence of the
Barnwell annalist and the Close Roll that Cambridge had passed into
the hands of Louis perhaps before <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hilary’s day, certainly not later
than ten days after its octave. We also know, from the Barnwell
annalist, that Louis did not gain possession of Hedingham till after the
simultaneous councils at Oxford and Cambridge. The inference seems
plain: Cambridge and either Colchester or Pleshey were surrendered
for the third truce; Hedingham, and whichever of the other two places
had not been surrendered on the same occasion as Cambridge, formed
the price of the fourth truce, the truce which was made after the councils
(<i>i.e.</i>, at the end of January or beginning of February), to last, as we learn
from Roger of Wendover as well as from the Barnwell writer, till a month
after Easter. The Flemish writer’s words about “many other castles”
are probably an exaggeration; there is nothing to indicate what these
other castles were; in any case they must have been of small importance.</p>

<p>One difficulty remains: the Biographer’s assertion that the second
truce was made “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">sanz le Mareschal</span>.” It seems impossible that this can
be correct; no “general truce” between Henry and Louis, such as is
clearly indicated by the letters patent, could have been made “without
the Marshal,” <i>i.e.</i>, without his participation and sanction as governor of
King and kingdom. We may, perhaps, account for the Biographer’s
mistake&mdash;for mistake it must surely be&mdash;somewhat as follows. The
policy of the Royalist leaders in negotiating truces on such terms was
doubtless too subtle for the understanding of most of the rank and file of
their party; it seems to have been too profound for the understanding
of the sturdy German constable of Berkhamsted, perhaps also for those
of Falkes’s Norman lieutenant at Hertford and of the constable of
Hedingham. The Marshal’s biographer evidently did not comprehend
its object at all, and so disapproved of it utterly. He hints at his disapproval
of the cession of Hertford and Berkhamsted&mdash;“<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">Seisis en fu,
<em>fust dreit ou tort</em></span>”; he gives us his undisguised opinion that when “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">cil
qui aveient la baillie autre trieve de vint jors pristrent</span>” at the price of
evacuating Orford and Norwich, “<em lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">si mespristrent</em>.” On the other hand,
he was not willing to admit that his hero could do wrong; so he
decided&mdash;with a bold disregard of what was implied in his own statement
that the terms were arranged by “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">cil qui aveient la baillie</span>”&mdash;that
this “mistake” must somehow have been made without the Marshal’s
concurrence.</p>

<p>The only two points where the walls of Lincoln city were ever “joined,”
in any way whatever, “with those of the castle,” are the two which I have
mentioned <a href="#Page_35" title="Go to page 35.">in <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 35</a>, viz., the north-western and the south-western angles
of the castle enclosure. At the former of these two points stood, we
know, the West Gate of the medieval city; and this <cite>Professor Oman
(<i>Art of War in the Middle Ages</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 410)</cite> considers to have been the
blocked gate of the poet’s story. I have said in my text that the blocked
gate “seems” to have been the West Gate, because it is quite possible
that there may have been a gate opening from the city at the other
junction-point of the two walls, immediately to the south of the castle
ditch. Unfortunately there is no evidence whether a gate at this point
ever existed or not. Two considerations arising out of the poet’s story
may seem at first glance to raise a slight presumption in favour of the
hypothesis that a gate did exist there, and was the one which he had in
mind. I think however that in both cases the presumption is more
apparent than real.</p>

<p>1. The poet represents Peter as setting out on his reconnaissance in
the city from the keep of the castle. He must, as <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Meyer says (<cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="L’Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal">Hist.
G. le Mar.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="3">iii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="159">clix</abbr></cite>), have issued from the small door opening at
the south-western angle of the keep. He would therefore, on reaching
the further side of the ditch, find himself close to the southern junction-point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>of the castle wall and the city wall. If there was a gate at this
point, and if it was the blocked one, his discovery of it and his return to
the castle might have been effected in a few minutes, without difficulty or
danger. If, on the other hand, the blocked gate was the West Gate
proper, he could not have seen it from the city without going all round
the southern, eastern, and northern sides of the castle, by a route
answering roughly to the present Drury Lane, Bailgate, and Westgate,
right through the heart of the city, and he must have returned by the
same lengthy and frequented way to the door in the keep whence he had
set out; an adventure which it seems hardly possible he could have
achieved in safety, except under one condition. That condition, however,
we may surely take for granted; it seems matter of course that before
he ventured outside the castle walls he would disguise himself so
as to look like an ordinary citizen going about his ordinary business in
the city. In that case the longer expedition might be quite practicable,
and really attended with very little risk. Moreover, if the blocked gate
was the West Gate, Peter must have known of its existence before
he entered the castle at all, for in going from the host to the sally-port
he would pass before the outer side of the West Gate; and this would
go far to account for his eagerness to explore the city&mdash;in other words, to
ascertain what was on the inner side of a blocked-up gate whose outer
side had already attracted his notice.</p>

<p>2. If there was a gate at the southern junction of the walls, it would
very probably be “of great antiquity”&mdash;as old as the second Roman
occupation of Lindum; for the wall itself thereabouts was certainly
Roman, as some fragments still remaining testify to this day. The West
Gate, on the other hand, in 1217 could not well be more than a hundred
and fifty years old. But the poet’s description of the blocked gate as
“<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">une vielle porte qui ert de grant antequite</span>” is a detail which&mdash;like his
use of the word <em lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">ancienement</em> in <cite><abbr title="line">l.</abbr> 16509</cite>&mdash;need not be taken literally.
Such phrases, when used by even a prose writer in an uncritical age,
may mean almost anything; moreover, epithets and descriptive phrases
of all kinds when used by a medieval writer of verse may occasionally
mean nothing. The poet had probably never seen the gate which
he was describing; those who told him about it were soldiers, not
archæologists; neither he nor they could have a very definite idea as to
when it had been built, or how long it had been obstructed. Possibly,
however, his use of the expressions above quoted may be accounted for
in another way. Lincoln “above hill” unquestionably possessed one
gate which even in 1217 could hardly fail to strike the most ignorant
observer as being already “of great antiquity.” Some of the poet’s
informants may have mentioned this to him, without specifying that it
was the North Gate or giving it a name. Others may have told him that
the North Gate was called New Port. If he was not further told that the
“New Port” and the ancient gate were identical, the fact of their
identity could not possibly enter his head; and as the North Gate and
the blocked gate were evidently the only two gates (of the city) which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
played any part in the day’s fighting until it reached the Bar-Gate far
away to the south beyond the river, he would naturally conclude that
since the first was the “new” gate, the second must be the ancient one.</p>

<p>The real difficulty of the passage is in <cite><abbr title="lines">ll.</abbr> 16515–16</cite>: “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno"><em>Por le chastel
plus enforcier</em> La fist abatre e trebuchier.</span>” How could the clearing out
and opening of a city gate&mdash;whether it were the West Gate or a
hypothetical gate further south&mdash;tend to reinforce, or strengthen, the
castle? Professor Tout, who rejects the whole story of Peter’s reconnaissance,
suggests (though without citing these lines) that if any
blocked-up gate was re-opened, it may have been the great west gate
(or sally-port) of the castle. He thinks that this gate may have been
“walled-up” as a measure of precaution, the postern serving in its stead
for ordinary communications, and that the difficulty of passing a large
number of men through an entrance so small and inaccessible as the
postern may have led to the reopening of the great gate, “so that the
relieving force could send a strong detachment into the enclosure”
(<cite><i><abbr title="English Historical Review">Eng. Hist. Rev.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> xviii, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 250, note</cite>). But this&mdash;whether it was the
fact or not&mdash;was certainly not the idea of the poet; for (1) the castle
sally-port does not “join the walls of the city with those of the castle”;
and (2) it is not (as the poet clearly represents <em>his</em> blocked gate to
have been) visible from inside the city.</p>

<span class="ch3">FALKES DE BRÉAUTÉ AT LINCOLN</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> story of Falkes’s entrance into the castle and his sally thence into
the town rests on the authority of <cite>Roger of Wendover (<abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 22)</cite>.
In the <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="L’Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal">Hist. G. le Mar.</abbr></i></cite> the only mention of Falkes in the whole account
of the day is in the following lines: “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">E quant les gens Fauques oïrent

“story supposes that Falkes did not enter the castle, but penetrated

them for their cowardice.” For this statement he cites as his authority

occupied with the discourse between the bishop and the Marshal, and
the mission of the scouts, summarized in my <a href="#Page_39" title="Go to page 39.">p. 39</a>. There is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
to connect <abbr title="lines">ll.</abbr> 16573–6 with either Falkes or Peter. <em lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">Cil qui vindrent</em>
cannot refer to the bishop <em>individually</em>. There is nothing to identify the
“<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">servanz qui leidement parti s’en erent</span>” with Falkes’s men; nothing to
suggest that Peter was one of “those who came” (whence and whither
we know not) and “met them” [<i>i.e.</i>, the “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">servanz</span>”] and “greatly abused
them when they had them fast in the crowd”; and nothing to indicate
that this meeting, described by the poet as having taken place <em lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">dans la
presse</em>, occurred as Mr. Tout says it did, in “the open country”; nothing
to connect these four lines with anybody or anything previously mentioned
in the poem.</p>

<p>In connexion with this point it will be well to consider an apparent
difficulty in <cite><abbr title="lines">ll.</abbr> 16541–5</cite>: “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">Li avesques al <abbr title="Mareschal">Mar.</abbr> dist: ‘Par mon chief! cist
ont mal fait, Car c’est la verite provee Qu’il n’ont pas unquore trovee La
dreite entree’</span>” etc. (see above, <a href="#Page_39" title="Go to page 39."><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 39</a>). In the poem as we now have it
this passage immediately follows the one about Falkes; <em lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">cist</em> in <cite><abbr title="line">l.</abbr> 16542</cite>,
therefore, would seem to refer to Falkes and his men. As, however,
any thing that happened to Falkes and his men must have happened
inside either the castle or the city, it could not become known to
those who were still outside the western wall so speedily as this
interpretation would imply; and I venture to think we may find
a probable explanation of the difficulty, without supposing the
poet to have been either so confused about the topography, or so
careless, as to overlook this obvious fact. The obscurity and seeming
incompleteness of the passage relating to Falkes, and the abruptness of
the transition in <cite><abbr title="lines">ll.</abbr> 16540–41</cite>, strongly suggest a <i>lacuna</i> in the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> at
this point. If there be one, it is probable that the missing lines
contained some further account of Falkes’s mishap; it is possible that
they may have also contained an account of some other transaction, the
actors in which were the subjects of Peter’s comment recorded in
<cite><abbr title="lines">ll.</abbr> 16541–5</cite>; and it is further possible that that transaction may have
been the attack on the North Gate recorded by Roger of Wendover.</p>

<p>(2) Roger makes no mention of the rally of the French in the
lower town, the second fight on the hill-top (“<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">entre le chastiel e le
moustier</span>,” see above, <a href="#Page_42" title="Go to pages 42, 43.">pp. 42, 43</a>), the second retreat or flight of the
French down hill, and the last fight on and near the bridge; he ends the
battle with the death of Perche, and then goes on thus: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Videntes igitur
Galligenae phalanges quod major eorum cecidisset, inierunt fugam tam
pedites quam equites sibi nimis damnosam; nam flagellum portae
australis, per quam fugerunt, quod ex transverso illius portae fuerat
fabricatum, fugientes non mediocriter impedivit; etenim quotiescunque
aliquis adveniens exire voluit, oportebat eum ab equo descendere et
portam aperire, quo exeunte porta denuo claudebatur flagello ut prius
posito ex transverso; sicque porta illa fugientibus nimis molesta fuit</span>”
(<cite><abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 23</cite>).</p>

<p>At first glance these two accounts might seem to relate to two distinct
occurrences at two different gates. “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">La dererene porte</span>,” which the
cow blocked against the fugitives when they had been driven beyond the
bridge “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">tote la rue contreval qui s’en veit dreit a l’hospital</span>,” is clearly
the Great (or West) Bar-Gate. This was quite literally the “outermost”
or “hindermost” gate of Lincoln to the southward; and outside it, on
the south side of the Sincil Dyke, stood two hospitals, one belonging to
the Order of Sempringham and named after the Holy Sepulchre, the
other a lazar-house dedicated to the Holy Innocents (<cite>Sympson, <i>Lincoln</i>,
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 386, 338, 344, 351</cite>). On the other hand, Roger’s <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">porta australis</em> with
the inconvenient sliding bar might, if we looked at his story alone, be
taken to represent the south gate of the city proper, <i>i.e.</i>, the Stone Bow.
But a comparison of his story with that of the poet shews this to
be impossible. Had it been the case, the greatest capture of prisoners
must have taken place <em>inside</em> the gate; whereas the Biographer clearly
indicates that most of the rebel barons (the De Quincys, Fitz Walter,
“<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">e moult d’autres dont point ne m’ennuie</span>”) were captured in the fight on
and near the bridge, <i>i.e.</i>, <em>outside</em> the Stone Bow (<cite><abbr title="lines">ll.</abbr> 16828–16939</cite>); and
even after all this, there were still so many left that when the “hindermost
gate” was at last reached, “<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno"><em>La</em> fu plus fort li encombriers, <em>La</em> ont molt
pris de chevaliers</span>” (<cite><abbr title="lines">ll.</abbr> 16955–6</cite>). Moreover, <cite><abbr title="lines">ll.</abbr> 16947–51</cite> (“<span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">En la porte
... nule maniere</span>”), especially <cite><abbr title="lines">ll.</abbr> 16947–8</cite>, where this same “hindermost
gate” is specially distinguished as <em lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">cele qui le fleel porte</em>, tally so closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
with Roger’s words about the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">flagellum</em> and its effects that we cannot
separate the two incidents. The difference between the two accounts is
simply that the poet gives us the whole topography and tells the whole
story, cow and all, while Roger leaves out the cow-incident, just as he
has left out several things of far greater importance (the second rally and
repulse of the French among them) in his story of the battle as a whole.</p>

<span class="ch3">THE TREATY OF KINGSTON</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> can be no reasonable doubt that the series of dates so carefully
given in our fullest and most strictly contemporary account of the
transactions connected with the treaty between Henry and Louis&mdash;the
account in the <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire des Ducs de Normandie</i></cite>&mdash;is correct. One of
the best contemporary English authorities, <cite>the Chronicle of Merton</cite>, is
in accord with it as to the dates on which the treaty was made and
Louis was absolved: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hoc anno</span>” (1217) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">facta est pax ... in quadam
insula extra Kingestune, feria tercia ante Exaltationem <abbr title="Sanctae">S.</abbr> Crucis</span>” (<i>i.e.</i>,
Tuesday, 12th September), “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et in vigilia Exaltationis</span>” (Wednesday, 13th
September) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">absolutus est dominus Lodowicus in eadem insula</span>” (<cite><i><abbr title="Chronicle of">Chron.</abbr>
Merton</i>, <i>apud</i> Petit-Dutaillis, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 514–515</cite>). Nearly all the other English
chroniclers give a wrong date to the peace; some make it 11th September,
others 13th September. The Patent Roll of 1216–17 settles the point
against them all; “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si Reginaldus de Cornhill terminos redempcionis
suae, statutos ante <em>diem Martis proximam ante Exaltacionem Sanctae
Crucis</em> anno regni nostro primo, <em>qua pax reformata fuit</em> inter nos et
Lodovicum domini regis Franciae primogenitum, servaverit</span>,” etc. (<cite><i>Pat.
Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 95</cite>, 25th September, 1217).</p>

<p>The Barnwell annalist (<cite><abbr title="Walter of Coventry">W. Cov.</abbr>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 239</cite>) gives no date for the
peace, but says Louis was absolved “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">die Mercurii proxima post
Exaltationem <abbr title="Sanctae">S.</abbr> Crucis</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, 20th September. Curiously enough, the copy
of the treaty printed by D’Achéry (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spicilegium</i>, <abbr title="edition">ed.</abbr> 1723, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="3">iii.</abbr>
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 586–7</cite>) appears to have borne the date “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lamech, anno ab Incarnatione
Domini <abbr title="1217" class="smcap">MCCXVII</abbr>, <abbr title="20" class="smcap">XX</abbr> die Septembris.</span>” Rymer, whose text
(<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Foedera</i>, <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 148</cite>) corresponds almost <i>verbatim</i> with D’Achéry’s in all
other respects, has the word <em  lang="la" xml:lang="la">undecimo</em> instead of the numerals <span class="smcap">XX</span>. The
title of “treaty of Lambeth,” by which&mdash;in defiance of all our authorities&mdash;the
agreement is commonly known, is derived solely from the dating
clause as printed by Rymer and D’Achéry. No original copy of the
treaty appears to be now known. In the eighteenth century three
versions of it were printed, one by Rymer, one by D’Achéry, a third by
Martène and Durand (<cite><i>Thesaurus Anecdotorum</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 857–859, <abbr title="edition">ed.</abbr>
1717</cite>). As to the source of Rymer’s copy we know absolutely nothing.
D’Achéry’s text was taken from the cartulary of the monastery of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Giles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
at Pontaudemer, that of Martène and Durand&mdash;which has no date at all&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex
<abbr title="manuscripto">MS.</abbr> illustrissimi Marchionis Daubais</span>.” Both of these must
obviously have been mere copies; and they differ so widely from each
other that they cannot have been derived, even remotely, from one and
the same original. The Daubais text not only omits several clauses
entirely, as well as all mention of place, date, witnesses, and seals,
and gives other clauses in a shortened form, but it inserts one interesting
clause of which there is no trace anywhere else&mdash;that about the Exchequer
documents (<a href="#Footnote_315" title="Go to Footnote 315.">above, footnote 315</a>). The Pontaudemer text, on the
other hand, is, except as regards the date, practically identical with that
which, for want of knowing its source, we can only call Rymer’s. This
last contains some verbal corruptions which may be due to Rymer
himself; while in D’Achéry’s printed text there is at least one obvious
error&mdash;the Legate’s name is given as “Gualterius.” The terms of the
treaty in the Rymer-Pontaudemer version are substantially the same as
those indicated by the chroniclers. The list of attestations comprises
only the names of the signataries on the English side; they are the
Legate, the King, the Regent, the Justiciar, the Earls of Chester,
Salisbury, Warren, and Arundel, William d’Aubigny, William Brewer,
William Marshal the younger, Falkes de Bréauté, Ralf de Mortimer,
“L. de Erdivert,” Robert de Vipont, Geoffrey de Neville, Brian de Lisle,
Philip d’Aubigné, and Richard the late King’s son; all of whom are
stated to have set their seals to the treaty. This is a somewhat puzzling
statement in view of the fact that the King had as yet no seal of his
own. It may be that the Marshal’s seal on this occasion did duty twice,
once for its owner and once for his royal ward; though we should
have expected, if this were so, to find an explicit mention of the
circumstance.</p>

<p>To me there seem to be only two alternative theories by which the
printed texts of the treaty can be reconciled with each other and
with the evidence of the chronicles: (1) that the document of which
Rymer and D’Achéry each had a copy before him was a transcript
(more or less exact) of the body of the original treaty of Kingston,
to which the list of signataries and the date had been added (the latter
incorrectly) from some unknown source; or (2) that the opening words&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Haec
est forma pacis facta</span>,” etc. (Rymer) or “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Haec est forma finis
et concordiae facta</span>,” etc. (D’Achéry)&mdash;were in each case the unauthorized
addition of a scribe, and that the original document was not an actually
executed treaty, but the draft which Hugh de Malaunay carried to Louis
on 11th September (above, <a href="#Page_56" title="Go to page 56.">p. 56</a>), and that this draft was sealed by
the Legate, King, and councillors, as a pledge of its authenticity and
of their intention to abide by its contents. I incline to the latter
alternative, for the following reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The so-called “form of peace” speaks throughout of what Louis
and Henry <em>shall</em> promise and swear, never once of what they <em>have</em>
promised and sworn. It seems therefore to date from a time previous
to the solemn oaths which Roger of Wendover says they took at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Kingston. The actual treaty would not be sealed till the oaths were
sworn.</p>

<p>(2) The difficulty about the dates, both of time and place, practically
disappears if we adopt the second theory. The date in Rymer can
hardly be explained away as a transcriber’s error, because the word
<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">undecimo</em> is given in full; it must be either correct, or a downright
blunder. Now, we know from <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire des Ducs de Normandie">Hist. Ducs</abbr></i> (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 203)</cite> that 11th September
was the day on which Malaunay carried back to Louis the “form of peace
drawn up in writing” (<cite><abbr title="Roger of Wendover">R. Wend.</abbr>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 30</cite>; <abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr> <a href="#Page_56" title="Go to pages 56, 57.">above, pp. 56, 57</a>) for
his acceptance. The Pontaudemer text may have been transcribed from
a copy in which the word had been translated into numerals, and if so,
“<span class="smcap">XI</span>” might easily become “<span class="smcap">XX</span>” in transcription. As for the place, we
know that King and regent were at Chertsey every day from 6th September
to 12th September, both days inclusive, and we possess no other notice
of their having gone to Lambeth on the 11th; but there is no reason why
they should not have done so; a prolongation of the truce till the 14th
had been guaranteed on the 10th, and it would be quite safe and
practicable for the Marshal and the Legate to bring their royal charge as
near to London as Lambeth for a few hours, if they found it convenient
to do so as a means of saving time in communicating with Louis.</p>

<p><cite>Mr. G. J. Turner (“Minority of Henry <abbr title="the Third">III</abbr>,” part <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, <i>Trans. Roy. Hist.
Soc.</i>, series II, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="18">xviii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 288, note 3)</cite> says, “The treaty was in two
parts, of which the text in the <i>Thesaurus</i> is the part executed by Louis.”
I do not understand on what grounds this inference is based, as the
Daubais (or <i>Thesaurus</i>) text has no attestations, and the formulae
employed in it are precisely the same as those in the Rymer-Pontaudemer
text, which purports to be attested by the English party.
Indeed, I cannot bring myself to believe that the Daubais text can
possibly represent the form in which the treaty was “executed” at
all. Save for the one clause which is peculiar to it, it is a mere summary,
and a very imperfect one, of some&mdash;by no means all&mdash;of the conditions
which the Rymer-Pontaudemer text sets forth in detail. My inference
from a comparison of the two texts is that the Daubais text is a mere
scribe’s epitome of a third text, now lost, which probably was the true
text of the treaty actually executed at Kingston on 12th September,
and consisted of the substance of the preliminary draft (the Rymer-Pontaudemer
text) <em>plus</em> the article about the Exchequer records.</p>

<h3 class="note" title="NOTE VI" id="note_VI">NOTE <abbr title="6">VI</abbr><br />

<span class="ch3">THE TENURE OF CROWN OFFICES DURING THE MINORITY</span></h3>

<p><cite>Mr. Turner (“Minority of Henry <abbr title="the Third">III</abbr>,” part <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 270–276)</cite> has gone
into this question with great care and in considerable detail. He sums
up his conclusions about it in four passages. (1) <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>“It is highly probable
that the three great officials, the two justices” (<i>i.e.</i>, the chief Justiciars
of England and Ireland) “and the Chancellor, claimed the right to
continue in office till the King’s minority had determined.... Direct
evidence of the claim is not forthcoming, but there are facts which
point to it having been put forward” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 271</cite>). (2) “The sheriffs and
castellans claimed to hold their bailiwicks throughout the King’s
minority” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 272</cite>). (3) “A dispute between Engelard de Cigogné and
William de Warenne as to which of them was entitled to the shrievalty
of Surrey shows that it was decided early in the reign that the sheriffs
who had been appointed by King John claimed the right to continue in
office until his successor attained his majority” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 274</cite>). (4) “It had
been decided that John’s sheriffs held office as of right during the
minority” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 275</cite>).</p>

<p>Thus Mr. Turner&mdash;if I understand him rightly&mdash;regards the existence
of this claim in the case of the great officers of state as merely a probable
inference; but in the case of the sheriffs and castellans he regards not
only the existence, but also the acknowledgment of the claim, as a fact,
proved, so far as the sheriffs are concerned, by the case of the shrievalty
of Surrey. That case is, briefly, as follows: Early in 1218 there were
two rival claimants to the sheriffdom of Surrey; Engelard de Cigogné,
who had been appointed to it by John in April, 1216, and William, Earl
of Warren. The grounds of William’s claim are unknown. The most
obvious conjecture is that he had received a grant, or a promise, of the
sheriffdom in the summer of 1217 as the price of his return to allegiance;
but this is only a conjecture; his claim may have been based on some old
prescriptive right&mdash;his proper territorial designation was Earl of Surrey&mdash;or
on some grant or promise made to him by John; John may have
granted or promised the sheriffdom to William, before William’s defection
from allegiance, on some special terms such as might justify William in
arguing that on his “reversion” the promise was binding on John’s
successor. The case was under consideration for nine months, from
1st February till November, 1218; and at the latter date it was still
undecided, but Engelard was promised that if the decision went against
him, he should be compensated by a grant of land and an annuity from
the Treasury. The decision is unrecorded; the end, however, was that
William got the sheriffdom and Engelard the promised compensation
(<cite>Turner, <abbr title="part">pt.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 274–5</cite>). Whether this was the result of a formal judgement
given by the Council in favour of Earl William’s claim, or of a
compromise agreed upon between the two claimants and sanctioned by
the Council, there is nothing to shew. On this case Mr. Turner comments:
“The mere fact that the dispute between Engelard de Cigogné
and William de Warenne arose, and was considered judicially by the
Council, shews that it had been decided that John’s sheriffs held office as
of right during the minority. Otherwise the dispute would have been
settled by the immediate appointment of one of the claimants or of a
third person without any consideration by the Council” (<cite><abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 275–276</cite>).</p>

<p>To me the evidence furnished by this case does not seem as conclusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
as it apparently does to Mr. Turner. The fact that the Council did not
settle the matter in the summary and arbitrary fashion in which, no doubt,
a King of full age would have settled it, does not to my mind necessarily
imply an acknowledgement of lack of competence so to settle it. Bearing
in mind that we know neither the origin and grounds of the dispute nor
the mode in which its final settlement was arrived at;&mdash;bearing in mind
also that the rival claimants were both of them men whose continued
attachment to the King it was important not to endanger&mdash;I venture
to think that the Council’s dealing with the case may have been dictated
chiefly, if not entirely, by motives of policy. Mr. Turner himself says, in
the very next sentence after the one which I have quoted above, “There
can be little doubt that Gualo and the Earl Marshal acted prudently in
allowing the sheriffs to continue in office” (<cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 276</cite>). Precisely; and they
would have acted very imprudently had they, without absolute necessity,
given offence either to a servant of the Crown so faithful and so efficient
as Engelard de Cigogné (who however, as we have just seen, did <em>not</em>
“continue in office”), or to a magnate so powerful and so lately “reverted”
as Earl William of Warren. To me it seems hardly safe to argue
decisively from a case so isolated and so obscure.</p>

<p>As for the castellans, the custody of some of the King’s castles
habitually (though not necessarily) went with that of the shires in which
they stood, but others were quite independent of the sheriffs. Mr.
Turner in his second article (<cite><i><abbr title="Transactions of the Royal Historical Society">Trans. Roy. Hist. Soc.</abbr></i>, 3rd <abbr title="series">ser.</abbr>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> I,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 247</cite>) says with reference to a document of 1220 (or 1221) relating to
Bristol castle: “Here we may see another recognition of the claim that
the castellans who had been appointed by John had the right to remain
in office during the King’s minority.” The only “other” instance given
by him of anything that can be construed into recognition of such a claim
on the part of a constable holding a royal castle independently (as
distinguished from a sheriff holding, in conjunction with his sheriffdom,
certain castles within his shire) is the case of Sauvey, which Geoffrey de
Serland was on 17th December, 1216, ordered to deliver to William
of Aumale, but with a proviso that if he were unwilling to do so, he
should come in person, or send a trusty representative, to hear the royal
commands concerning the matter (<cite><i><abbr title="Patent">Pat.</abbr> Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 13</cite>; <cite id="Note_6a">Turner, <abbr title="part">pt.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II</abbr>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 236</cite>). This seems to indicate that, as Mr. Turner says (<cite><i><a href="#Note_6a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">l.c.</a></i></cite>), “The
Marshal evidently thought it prudent to give him [Geoffrey] a voice in
the appointment of his successor”; but it proves nothing as to any claim
of right on Geoffrey’s part having been recognized by the Marshal and
his colleagues, or even put forth by Geoffrey himself. The Bristol
document has in reality no bearing at all upon the point under consideration.
It is a letter patent whereby, in December, 1220, or January,
1221 (see above, <a href="#Page_175" title="Go to page 175.">p. 175</a>), the Justiciar and six other members of the royal
Council became sureties for the King to Hugh de Vivonne, who was going
to Poitou as seneschal of that country, that if Hugh should be recalled
or should resign his office and return to England, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">idem dominus noster
rex restituet ei castrum Bristolliae sicut illud prius tenuit, vel assignabit
ei aliam wardam in custodia alicujus castri vel terrarum ad valentiam
<em id="Note_6b">custodiae praedicti castri Bristolliae et terrarum quam habuit de ballio

Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 306, 307</cite>). <a href="#Note_6b" title="Go to italicized sentence.">The sentence which I have italicized</a>, construed
literally, should of course mean that Hugh had originally received the
custody of Bristol castle, and of certain lands, by a grant from John, and
that this grant had been renewed by Henry. But whatever may have
been the case with regard to the other lands here referred to, this was not
the fact with regard to Bristol. Until 19th September, 1219, Hugh de
Vivonne was merely lieutenant constable of Bristol castle for Savaric de
Mauléon; on that day he, acting in pursuance of Savaric’s instructions
and for Savaric (who had made up his mind not to return to England),
surrendered it into the King’s hand, and thereupon immediately received
it back again to hold “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quamdiu nobis placuerit</span>” as constable in his own
person (<cite><i><abbr title="Patent">Pat.</abbr> Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 203</cite>).</p>

<p>I will not dispute that a claim to continuity of tenure was made,
explicitly or implicitly, by some of the castellans, and that <em>in practice</em>
they mostly succeeded in enforcing it; but that it ever received formal
“recognition” seems to me disproved by (<i>a</i>) the oath of the barons at
Henry’s second coronation, and (<i>b</i>) the Pope’s letters on the subject
of the royal castles.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “From the annals of Dunstable we learn that on the morrow
of the coronation (in 1220) the barons who were there present swore that
they would resign their castles and wardships” (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">castra et wardias suas</span></i>) “at
the King’s will, and would faithfully render accounts of their farms at the
Exchequer” (<cite>Turner, <abbr title="part">pt.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 239</cite>; see the original, from <cite><i><abbr title="Annals of Dunstable">Ann. Dunst.</abbr></i>
<abbr title="anno">a.</abbr> 1220</cite>, <a href="#Footnote_680" title="Go to Footnote 680.">above, footnote 680</a>). This oath&mdash;taken at a time (18th May,
1220) when it had not yet been settled whether Henry was to attain his
majority at fourteen or at twenty-one, and when his actual age was twelve
years and seven months&mdash;is clearly to be understood as a promise
to yield up the castles of which they had custody, and render account for
them, whenever they should in the King’s name be called upon to do so,
from that day forth, not merely after the King’s coming of age. Mr.
Turner understands it thus, for he comments upon the passage, “In all
probability the chief object of these proceedings was to obtain the castles
of Rockingham and Sauvey from the Count of Aumale” (<cite><abbr title="part">pt.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 240</cite>).
(<i>b</i>) On 26th May, 1220, the Pope issued orders that all prelates holding
royal castles should surrender them; and on 28th May, that no man should
be suffered to retain the custody of more than two royal castles at once
(<cite><i><abbr title="Royal Letters">Roy. Lett.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> I, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 535, 121</cite>; <abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr> <a href="#Page_146" title="Go to pages 146, 147.">above, pp. 146, 147</a>, and <cite>Turner, <abbr title="part">pt.</abbr> <abbr title="2">II</abbr>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 242</cite>). To me it appears that these letters are incompatible with
any “recognition” by the Pope&mdash;who, be it remembered, was acknowledged
by all parties as the legal overlord of England and the chief
guardian of the King&mdash;of the doctrine of the castellans’ right to continuity
of tenure during the King’s minority; and that the oath taken after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
coronation is equally incompatible with any such recognition on the part
of the regents in England, or even with any general recognition of that
doctrine among the castellans themselves.</p>

<p>With regard to the great officers of state, Mr. Turner’s inference is
based (<cite><abbr title="part">pt.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 271</cite>) on (1) the case of Geoffrey de Marsh, Justiciar in
Ireland; (2) that of Richard de Marsh, Chancellor of England; (3) the
parallel, or analogy, between the position of the great officers of the
Crown and that of the lesser ones&mdash;“the sheriffs and castellans claimed
to hold their bailiwicks throughout the King’s minority, and the greater
officers of state must have considered that they were entitled to the same
privilege” (<cite><abbr title="part">pt.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, 272</cite>). Of (1) I have given the whole story in my text,
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_94" title="Go to pages 94, 95.">94, 95</a>, <a href="#Page_123" title="Go to pages 123–125.">123–125</a>, <a href="#Page_174" title="Go to pages 174, 175.">174, 175</a>, <a href="#Page_217" title="Go to page 217.">217</a>, <a href="#Page_259" title="Go to page 259.">259</a>. Of (2) Mr. Turner says: “Richard
de Mareis, the Chancellor, seems to have grievously neglected his
office, and to have left his duties to be performed by Ralph de Neville,
the vice-chancellor. It is scarcely likely that he would have been permitted
to enjoy the emoluments of his office while repudiating its burden,
if he could have been removed” (<cite><abbr title="part">pt.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 272</cite>). The Chancellor’s office,
unlike that of the Justiciar or the sheriffs, was necessarily vacated by the
death of the King, inasmuch as he held it (as Mr. Turner points out, <cite><abbr title="part">pt.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I</abbr>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 271</cite>) not by letters patent but by virtue of the delivery of the King’s
seal into his hands, and every King had a new seal. The Chancellor
appointed by John therefore, could not “claim the right to <em>continue</em> in
office until the king’s minority had determined”; such continuity was
impossible in an office conferred by the delivery of a symbol which
changed with a change of sovereigns. He <em>may</em>, as a great minister of the
Crown, have claimed a right to be re-appointed for the term of the King’s
minority. A formal re-appointment would not be possible in his case till
the new great seal was made, and this was not till October, 1218;
but there may have been an informal agreement by which he was left in
possession of the functions and rights appertaining to the chancellorship
throughout the two years during which the Marshal’s seal was used
instead of the King’s, on the understanding that when this latter arrangement
terminated he was to receive the new seal in the usual way. Such
an agreement need not, however, imply any right of continuity in office.
Richard de Marsh was not the only Chancellor who habitually left his
duties to a deputy and yet was suffered to retain his title and his profits.
As to (3), it would certainly appear that since justiciars, sheriffs, and
castellans were all appointed in the same manner and on the same terms&mdash;by
letters patent, to hold office during the King’s pleasure&mdash;the greater
officers must have been irremoveable during the minority, <em>if the lesser ones
were acknowledged to be so</em>. For the reasons already given, this latter
point seems to me not proven.</p>

<p>With regard to the castles a further question remains. Falkes de
Bréauté in the “Complaint” which he addressed to the Pope in 1225, and
which is preserved in the Barnwell Annals, speaking of the arrest
of Peter de Maulay in 1221, says: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De qua captione non ante dictus
nobilis evadere potuit quam ea castra quae sibi tam a domino Guala
quam etiam a patre domini regis commissa fuerant restitueret, contra
pristinum juramentum quod patri fecerat de non restituendis eisdem
castris donec iste rex legitimae foret aetatis</span>” (<cite><abbr title="Walter of Coventry">W. Cov.</abbr>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> II, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 260</cite>).
On this Mr. Turner (<cite><abbr title="part">pt.</abbr> <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 284</cite>) observes: “The castles, he says, were
entrusted to Pierre as well by Guala as by King John. It would seem
from this that although the castellans were not re-appointed on the King’s
death by letters patent under the seal of the Earl Marshal, their castles
were formally delivered to them by Guala. The statement is confirmed
by a letter dated May 10th, 1220, from Pandulph, who succeeded Guala as
legate, to Ralph de Neville the vice-chancellor, in which he asks him to
send the form under which Guala delivered castles to their wardens
(<cite>Shirley, <i>Royal Letters</i>, <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> 117</cite>).” Pandulf’s words are these: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Item,
formam sub qua dominus Gualo castra ad custodiendum tradebat nobis
mittas, si ipsam habes, vel ab his qui sciunt diligenter inquiras, et quod
inveneres nobis rescribas.</span>”</p>

<p>I venture to think that Mr. Turner’s suggested interpretation of these
two passages is a little overstrained. The words of Falkes need not
imply any formal act of delivery posterior to the one whereby Peter had
originally received the castles to hold for John. <cite>Falkes’s “Complaint”</cite>
is not a legal document, and we are neither obliged nor entitled to
construe its phraseology as if it were such. If certain castles which John
had committed to a certain man were left in that man’s custody by
Henry’s guardians, they were practically committed or entrusted to him
by the guardians as well as by John; and a reason why Falkes should
bring Gualo’s name into the matter, rather than the name of the
Marshal, is not far to seek. <cite>Falkes’s “Complaint”</cite> is a piece of special
pleading addressed to a special person&mdash;the Pope&mdash;for the purpose of
inducing him (as supreme guardian of his feudatary King Henry) to
intervene in English affairs in behalf of the complainant Falkes himself;
the case of Peter de Maulay being mentioned as an illustration of the ill-treatment
which (according to Falkes) the leaders of the party now in
power in England were meting out to faithful old servants of King John.
In these circumstances it is perfectly natural that whatever sanction,
whether explicit or tacit, was, at a time when these leaders were in a
subordinate position, given by the highest authorities in the realm to
Peter’s retention of the castles in his keeping, should be described as
having been given by the Legate. Nor need the words of Pandulf bear
any more definite meaning. The letter in which they occur was misdated
by Dr. Shirley; its true date is 10th May, 1219 (see <cite>Prof. Powicke in
<i><abbr title="English Historical Review">Eng. Hist. Rev.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="23">xxiii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 229</cite>), when Pandulf had been Legate about
five months, and regent less than as many weeks. That he, at this time,
supposed the castles to have been delivered to their wardens by Gualo is
no proof that such was the fact. Moreover, the wording of his inquiry
suggests that he had no very distinct idea of the thing about which he
was inquiring; indeed, it almost suggests some uncertainty on his part
whether what he asked for existed at all. I venture to think that&mdash;Ralf
de Neville’s answer being unfortunately lost&mdash;in this uncertainty the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
question still remains. It would be a very remarkable circumstance if
Gualo, who so scrupulously refrained from all shew of intervention in the
administration of civil affairs, went out of his way to take upon himself a
function utterly alien from his natural sphere of action, and one which
there could be no conceivable reason for associating with his office rather
than with that of the lay regent. It would be equally remarkable that
the castellans, if they considered themselves entitled to retain their
wardenships without re-appointment by letters patent from the Governor
of King and Kingdom, in the new sovereign’s name, should have quietly
submitted to re-appointment in a wholly unprecedented manner at the
hands of a foreign ecclesiastic. And it is scarcely less remarkable that a
proceeding so unusual, if it really took place, should have left no trace in
the official records of the Kingdom and been passed over in silence by all
the chroniclers of the time.</p>

<span class="ch3">THE PAPAL LETTERS OF 1223</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> four papal letters summarized in <a href="#Page_202" title="Go to page 202.">p. 202</a> are to be found in the
<cite>Red Book of the Exchequer, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 171</cite>. The letter which there stands first
of the four&mdash;that to the Earls and barons of England&mdash;is printed in
<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Foedera</i>, <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 190</cite> (with a marginal date, 1228, which does not agree with
the date at the end of the letter itself). The salutation of all four is given
in <cite>the Red Book</cite> as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gregorius Papa</span>,” etc., and the date as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">idus Aprilis
anno primo</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, 13th April, 1227. The fact that some instructions
about Henry’s coming of age, and about the castles, were issued by
Honorius <abbr title="the Third">III</abbr> in 1223 appears from at least three independent sources: the
<cite>Dunstable Annals</cite>, <cite>Roger of Wendover</cite>, and the <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Querimonia Falcasii</i></cite>.
For the precise wording of any portion of these instructions, and the
date on which they (or a portion of them) were issued, the sole authority
which has hitherto been recognized is a dateless letter preserved among
the “bundles” in the Public Record Office, and printed by Shirley in
<cite><i><abbr title="Royal Letters">Roy. Lett.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 430, 431</cite>. Its salutation runs “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sanctissimo patri
... G. Dei gratia summo pontifici, P. Wintoniensis et H. Elyensis divina
miseratione episcopi</span>”; <i>i.e.</i> it is a letter to Pope Gregory IX from Bishops
Hugh of Ely who was consecrated in June, 1229, and Peter of Winchester
who died in June, 1238. (Why Shirley dated this letter “June, 1232&mdash;April,
1234,” I cannot guess.) These two prelates write: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Noverit
sancta paternitas vestra nos mandatum piae recordationis Honorii praedecessoris
vestri propriis manibus tractasse et oculis propriis inspexisse
in haec verba: ‘Honorius episcopus, servus servorum Dei, dilecto filio ...’</span>
(Shirley left a blank for the name or initial; presumably it was undecipherable)
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Cycestrensi electo, carissimi in Christo filii nostri regis Anglorum
vice-cancellario, salutem et apostolicam benedictionem.’</span>” They then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
proceed to quote the whole letter; and it is absolutely identical with the
fourth of the letters concerning Henry’s majority, ascribed in the Red
Book to Gregory, except that its date is “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">idus Aprilis, pontificatus nostri
anno septimo</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, 13th April, 1223. Long ago Dr. Stubbs remarked that
“Curiously enough, the bull of Gregory IX to the same effect” [as the
letters in which Honorius on 13th April, 1223, had “declared Henry,
although not yet of age, competent to govern”] “is dated 13th April,
1227” (<cite><i>Const. Hist.</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 34, note 2, 1875</cite>). A careful consideration
of the subject has led me to the conviction that this “curious” correspondence
of month and day is due to the fact that the words <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">idus Aprilis</em> are
the only correct part of the date as given by the scribe of <cite>the Red Book</cite>,
and that the four letters have been attributed by him to a wrong Pope,
being in reality all alike letters of Honorius <abbr title="the Third">III</abbr>, issued on 13th April, 1223.</p>

<p>These four letters obviously form a group whose members are so
inseparably inter-related that they must stand or fall together. The
chief member of this group is not the one which the Exchequer scribe
has placed at its head (the one printed in <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Foedera</i></cite>), but that which he has
placed second, and which is addressed to Peter des Roches, Hubert de
Burgh, and William Brewer conjointly. It is these three men whom the
Pope charges to give the young King free disposition of his realm; the
addressees of the other three letters are merely bidden to perform the
special duties which will fall to them severally as a consequence of this
primary command, which the Pope in each case expressly tells them he
is giving to Peter, Hubert, and William. We have seen that the fourth
letter is textually identical with one which, according to Bishops Peter and
Hugh, was written on 13th April, 1223, by Honorius to the vice-chancellor.
This identity extends to the salutation (except of course as to the writer’s
name); in <cite>the Red Book</cite> version, as in that of the two bishops, the letter
is addressed “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cycestrensi electo, vice-cancellario.</span>” Now, the only man
who was at the same time “elect of Chichester and vice-chancellor” was
Ralf de Neville (who was elected to Chichester early in 1223); and before
the first year of Pope Gregory began, Ralf had ceased to be either the
one or the other&mdash;he had become Bishop of Chichester and Chancellor.
Thus the compiler of the portion of <cite>the Red Book</cite> in which these letters
occur has luckily betrayed his own error. Probably he had, in the first
draft of his notes, copied these letters from their originals in the Exchequer
without putting the Pope’s name or initial at their head, and when he
came to re-copy his notes into <cite>the Red Book</cite> he&mdash;writing at a time when
Henry’s first coming of age was no longer a matter of practical importance
and may well have been almost forgotten, knowing that Henry had been
set free from the trammels of minority while still under age, and in the
first year of Gregory IX, and failing to notice the chronological indication
conveyed in the address <em lang="la" xml:lang="la" id="Note_7a">Cycestrensi electo vice-cancellario</em>&mdash;ascribed the
letters to Gregory, and (as he doubtless imagined) corrected the year
accordingly. The  <a href="#Note_7a" title="Go to italicized words.">words which I have italicized</a> are indeed not the only
ones which shew that he was mistaken in so doing. The whole contents
of all four letters fit in perfectly with the circumstances of 1223; but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
considerable portion of those contents is quite inappropriate to the
circumstances of 1227. At this latter date the controversy about the
castles was a thing of the past.</p>

<p>In further confirmation of this view of the matter, we find Hubert, in his
answers to a long indictment brought against him by the King in 1239,
quoting, from four letters addressed (1) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Comitibus et baronibus</span>,” (2) and
(3) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Comiti Cestriae</span>” and “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub eisdem verbis Wintoniensi Episcopo</span>,”
(4) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cancellario</span>,” passages which all occur in the letters correspondingly
addressed in <cite>the Red Book</cite>, and he describes all these quotations as taken
from privileges of Pope Honorius. These answers were put into writing
by Master Laurence of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Alban’s; Laurence’s notes were preserved in a
commonplace book of his abbey, and they figure among the miscellaneous
collections of Matthew Paris as <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Responsiones Magistri Laurentii de
<abbr title="Sancto">S.</abbr> Albano pro comite Kantiae Huberto de Burgo</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Chronica Majora">Chron. Maj.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="6">vi.</abbr>
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 63–74)</cite>. The answers in general have an appearance of honesty; but
they were drawn up many years after the occurrence of some of the events
to which they relate; and from this or some other cause the version given
in them of the whole story of Henry’s coming of age is extremely confused,
and certainly inaccurate in some particulars, the events of 1227 and those
of 1223 being inextricably mixed up together. Hubert’s description of
the Pope’s letter about the great seal as addressed “<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cancellario</em>,”
however, presents no difficulty. The word may stand simply for “him
who is Chancellor now,” or the prefix <em>vice</em> may have been omitted by the
scribe.</p>

<p>Of the letter in which Honorius bade the prelates enforce by ecclesiastical
censure a general surrender of all the royal castles (above, <a href="#Page_206" title="Go to page 206."><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 206</a>),
no actual copy is known; but there is no reason to question the accuracy
of Roger of Wendover’s report of its contents. That report is, I think,
confirmed by the brief but significant statements of Falkes de Bréauté.
In 1225 Falkes (probably with the help of Robert Passelewe, a well
known man of law) drew up a “<cite>Complaint</cite>” addressed to the Pope
and Cardinals about the recent proceedings in England against himself.
This complaint is inserted in the Barnwell Annals under the heading
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Querimonia Falcasii coram Domino Papa</i> (<cite><abbr title="Walter of Coventry">W. Cov.</abbr>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="2">ii.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 259–272</cite>).
It sets the whole political history of England during the years 1221–1224
in a light startlingly different from that in which the same history is
treated by the chroniclers; and although its author certainly had good
opportunity of knowing the truth about the matters of which he wrote,
there are obvious reasons which make him a dangerous authority to rely
upon implicitly. The fact, however, that the “<cite>Complaint</cite>” was addressed
to Honorius furnishes some guarantee of the correctness of its statements
so far as they relate to the action of Honorius himself. These statements
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<p>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum <em id="Note_7b">a sede apostolica jussio processisset ut castra, ballia, et caetera

Musard and of Chester’s rising, see above, <a href="#Page_203" title="Go to pages 203–204.">pp. 203, 204</a>). “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Interim

two passages which I have italicized</a> the compulsory surrender of all

the papal mandate referred to, the King’s majority being apparently

I think we may gather from these two passages that the papal mandates
which Falkes had in his mind were not those preserved in <cite>the Royal

<cite>Roger of Wendover</cite>. <cite>The Dunstable annalist</cite> says that Henry’s <i>quasi</i>-majority
was decided upon and proclaimed “by order of the Pope and
assent of the barons,” <i>i.e.</i>, the Pope’s letter to Peter, Hubert, and William
Brewer was published in a council at London, on the King’s return from
Wales (see above, <a href="#Footnote_921" title="Go to Footnote 921.">footnote 921</a>). The Rolls shew that Henry reached
London on 22nd October and remained there till 8th November (<cite><i>Close
Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 566&nbsp;b, 567, 575&nbsp;b, 576</cite>). As, however, it was not till
9th December that Henry began to attest his own letters, it seems that
either the annalist’s date must not be taken literally, or the proclamation
remained inoperative for more than a month. I think it can be shewn
that the latter was the case. The Rolls indicate that the affair of Walter
de Lacy and Ralf Musard had taken place before 15th November (above, <a href="#Footnote_924" title="Go to Footnote 924.">
footnote 924</a>). Falkes says that after that affair Henry and Hubert
went to Gloucester; the Rolls shew that they were at Gloucester
16–22nd November (<cite id="Note_7d"><i>Close Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 575&nbsp;b–576&nbsp;b</cite>). Chester’s
attempt on the Tower must have been made during their absence from
London. We know from the Rolls that they were there again from
28th November till 12th, perhaps till 19th December (<i><a href="#Note_7d" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 576&nbsp;b–579);
the rebels’ appearance before them and the scene between Peter and
Hubert must thus have taken place there between 28th November and
5th December, since, as we learn from <cite>Falkes (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 261)</cite>, the “truce” arranged
immediately after it by Langton began on 6th December. It was only in
this December council that “the papal letters which declared him (Henry)
of age were acted upon” (<cite id="Note_7e">Powicke, <i><abbr title="English Historical Review">Eng. Hist. Rev.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="23">xxiii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 221</cite>),
<i>i.e.</i>, that the King began to attest his own letters, and, probably, the great
seal began to follow the King instead of being kept at the Exchequer (<i><a href="#Note_7e" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 224). Falkes, however, seems to imply that the papal command “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut
castra, ballia, et caetera quae sunt regis a cunctis tenentibus redderentur</span>”
was known in England before the affair of Lacy and Musard took place.
On the other hand he tells us that certain Apostolic letters <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in quibus
continebatur quod esset domino regi restitutio rerum suarum facienda</span>”
were “exhibited”&mdash;seemingly for the first time&mdash;at Christmas. To me
all this seems to indicate that the letter to Peter, Hubert, and William
and the letter to the prelates, had both reached the English court before
the end of October; that the first was published then as the annalist
says, but was not carried into immediate effect; that the second was
published, as Roger implies, early in December, but that a number of
barons&mdash;Falkes among them&mdash;not being present at its publication, had
no <em>official</em> knowledge of it till it was “exhibited” to them at Christmas.</p>

<p>While the barons in general seem to have regarded Hubert as the
instigator of the papal order for a compulsory surrender of castles, etc.,
Falkes, hostile though he is to the Justiciar, neither asserts nor hints at
any thing of the kind. He says indeed nothing whatever as to any
suspicions which he or others may have had concerning the origin of that
order. Yet I cannot but think that he had a suspicion, and possibly not
altogether an unlikely one. Both on personal and political grounds Falkes
is bitter enough against Hubert; to him, Hubert is a personal enemy
and also an enemy of the peace and prosperity of King and kingdom;
but he is neither the sole nor the chief enemy. Throughout his
“Complaint,” even in reference to matters in which Hubert appears as
the principal or the sole actor, Falkes speaks of “the Justiciar and his
accomplices”; and the foremost of these “accomplices,” according to
Falkes’s version of history, is the Archbishop of Canterbury. It is
Stephen, not Hubert, who is the arch-enemy in the eyes of Falkes&mdash;the
relentless persecutor of Falkes himself, the persistent sower of discord
and plotter of mischief in the realm; one passage relating to him in
the <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Querimonia</i></cite> reads almost like a paraphrase of the accusation said by
<cite>the Dunstable annalist</cite> to have been flung, in a moment of fury, by Hubert
at Peter des Roches (above, <a href="#Page_207" title="Go to page 207.">p. 207</a>). The animus displayed by Falkes
against Stephen is in fact so violent that we instinctively feel his narrative
is not to be trusted <em>in details</em> where the Archbishop is concerned. Yet
there is no intrinsic impossibility in its account of the formal surrender
of the castles, in which Stephen is distinctly made to play the most
prominent part (above, <a href="#Page_210" title="Go to page 210.">p. 210</a>). We have seen the difficulties involved
in supposing that the Pope’s action was prompted by any person or party
among the other councillors of the Crown. Can it have been prompted&mdash;on
the broad ground of the interest of public order and stable
government, irrespective of persons and parties&mdash;by the Archbishop of
Canterbury?</p>

order in which they appear on the Roll, and accompanied by some other
entries which have no direct bearing on the general surrender and
redistribution of castles after Christmas, 1223. The entries whose date is
earlier than 29th December, 1223, have of course also no bearing upon that
subject. A summary analysis, in chronological order, of those which do
relate to it may therefore be useful to elucidate and check the statements

<p>From 30th December, 1223, to 13th March, 1224, (after which no further
important changes seem to have taken place for some time) orders were
issued for the transfer of the custody of thirty-three castles, viz: Shrewsbury,
Bridgenorth, Lancaster, Kenilworth, Windsor, Odiham, Knaresborough,
the Peak, Bolsover, Salisbury, Devizes, Corfe, Bristol, Sherborne, Lincoln,
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Briavel’s, Oxford, Northampton, Hertford, Rochester, Norwich, Orford,
Dover, Canterbury, Hereford, Winchester, Porchester, Southampton,
Carisbrook, Christchurch, Plympton, Marlborough, Luggershall. On
30th December Earl Ranulf of Chester was bidden to deliver the castles of
Shrewsbury and Bridgenorth, and the shires of Salop and Stafford, to
Hugh le Despenser. In the custody of Lancaster castle, county, and
honour Ranulf was to be superseded by Earl Ferrers. Kenilworth castle
and the shires of Leicester and Warwick were transferred from William
de Cantelupe to John Russell; Windsor and Odiham from Engelard de
Cigogné to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Brian de Lisle was ordered
to deliver Knaresborough to the Archbishop of York, the Peak and
Bolsover to Robert of Lexington, who was however to receive the latter
fortress not for himself, but to hand it over to William Brewer (<cite id="Note_8a"><i><abbr title="Patent">Pat.</abbr> Rolls</i>,
<abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 418</cite>). Earl William Longsword was to deliver the castle of
Salisbury, William Brewer that of Devizes and Ralf Gernon that of Corfe, to the Bishop of Salisbury.
Bristol castle was to pass from the Bishop of Norwich (Pandulf), Sherborne
castle and the sheriffdom of Somerset from John Russell, to the Bishop
of Bath; Lincoln castle from Stephen de Sedgrave to the bishop of the
diocese (<cite><i><a href="#Note_8a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 419</cite>. It is not quite clear whether at this time Stephen de
Sedgrave was castellan of Lincoln in his own person, or as assistant to
Nicolaa de Haye). Falkes de Bréauté was to deliver the castle and shire
of Oxford to Richard de Rivers; those of Northampton to Ralf de Trubleville;
and the castle of Hertford to William of Eynesford (<cite><i><a href="#Note_8a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 418</cite>).
The Justiciar was to deliver the castles of Rochester, Norwich, Orford,
and Hereford, to their respective diocesan bishops, Dover and Canterbury
to the Primate (<cite><i><a href="#Note_8a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 418–419</cite>). The supersession of John of Monmouth
as custodian of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Briavel’s and of the Forest of Dene is expressly stated
to be due to his voluntary resignation on the score of ill-health; on
4th January, 1224, the castle and Forest were committed momentarily to the
Bishop of Hereford, to be by him delivered to Walter Asmoins, whom the
King appointed warden of them under Ralf FitzNicholas (<cite><i><a href="#Note_8a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 419–420</cite>).</p>

<p>On 7th January, 1224, the Bishop of Winchester was ordered to deliver the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
castles of Winchester, Porchester, and Southampton, with the sheriffdom
of Hampshire, to the Bishop of Salisbury. Within five days, however,
Jocelyn was superseded in all these bailiwicks by the Earl of Salisbury.
On 12th January Hertford castle was transferred from its newly appointed
constable, William of Eynesford, to Stephen de Sedgrave (<cite><i><a href="#Note_8a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 420</cite>), who
again was on 23rd January superseded there by Richard de Argentine (<cite><i><a href="#Note_8a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i>
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 425</cite>). An order was issued on 12th January for the transfer of Windsor
and Odiham to Hubert de Burgh, but seems to have been cancelled, for
on 4th February these two castles were still in the hands to which they had
been committed on 30th December&mdash;those of the Primate, who was now
bidden to deliver them to Osbert Giffard (<cite><i><a href="#Note_8a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 420, 421</cite>). On 2nd February
Falkes was ordered to deliver Carisbrook and Christchurch to Waleran
the German (“le Theys”) to whom the King had given them in custody
together with the lands of the late Earl Willam of Devon and the castle of
Plympton (<cite><i><a href="#Note_8a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 427</cite>). On 7th February the Bishop of Norwich was ordered
to deliver Marlborough castle to Robert Wolf (“Lupus”; <cite><i><a href="#Note_8a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 426</cite>). On
2nd March another new constable was appointed to Marlborough, Robert
de Meisy, who was at the same time made constable of Luggershall;
whether John Little, who was ordered to deliver these two fortresses to
Meisy (<cite><i><a href="#Note_8a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 428</cite>), was sub-warden of them for the recently appointed
Wolf or for Pandulf, does not appear. On 11th March Robert de Lexington
was bidden to deliver Bolsover to William Brewer (<cite><i><a href="#Note_8a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 429</cite>), for whom
he had received it in January. On 13th March Pandulf was desired to
deliver Bristol “without delay” to Reginald de Hurle and John Little (<cite><i><a href="#Note_8a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i></cite>).
Lastly, on the same day, Plympton, of which Waleran “le Theys” had
been appointed custodian six weeks before, was committed to Walter de
Falkenberg (<cite><i><a href="#Note_8a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 430</cite>). This appointment, like that of Waleran, proved
ineffectual, owing to the resistance of Falkes. Falkes had on 18th January
been ordered to deliver the shires of Bedford and Buckingham to William
de Pateshull, and those of Cambridge and Huntingdon to Richard de
Argentine (<cite ><i>Close Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 581&nbsp;b</cite>; <abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr> <cite id="Note_8b"><i><abbr title="Patent">Pat.</abbr> Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 421</cite>); the
two latter shires were immediately transferred again, to Geoffrey de
Heathfield (<cite><i><abbr title="Patent">Pat.</abbr> Rolls</i>, <i><a href="#Note_8b" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">l.c.</a></i></cite>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> number of illegal disseisins of which Falkes was convicted at
Dunstable in June, 1224 (above, <a href="#Page_231" title="Go to page 231.">p. 231</a>), is officially stated as sixteen:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum ... Falcatius ... coram judicibus eisdem in sexdecim causis fuisset

copies this; and in an original paragraph of his own, inserted at the
end of Roger’s account of the Bedford affair, he says that Falkes “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="32">xxxii</abbr>
liberos homines in manerio de Luituna sine judicio de suis tenementis

says “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Falchasius de triginta quinque saisinis convictus est.</span>” Of course
the evidence of the King’s letter is decisive. Roger’s odd phrase, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de
plusquam triginta <em>paribus litterarum</em></span>,” reveals how the number came to
be doubled. At some date obviously earlier (probably not less, possibly
much more, than six months earlier, since the complaint of the earls is
addressed to the Justiciar, not the King) than this Dunstable affair, the
Earls of Salisbury and Pembroke, writing to Hubert about Falkes’s
outrageous conduct towards John Marshal, reported “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod dominus
Johannes Marescallus nobis per literas suas mandavit quod, cum misisset

declaration, uttered in a moment of anger, that “<i>if</i> thirty pairs of royal
letters should be sent to him” in behalf of one particular person, he
would pay no heed to them, seemingly became confused, before it reached
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Alban’s and Dunstable, with a wholly different matter, and the “thirty
pairs of letters” were supposed to have been actually sent, as the
consequence of his conviction before Henry de Braybroke of the same
number of disseisins; <cite>Roger</cite> or his informant inserted a “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">plusquam</span>” on
the strength of which <cite>Matthew</cite> raised the number to thirty-two; while

<span class="ch3">BEDFORD CASTLE</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> nature of Falkes’s tenure of Bedford castle is a question of some
difficulty. The only entry relating to it in the Rolls is provokingly laconic:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mandatum est Waltero de Bellocampo quod habere faciat Falkesio de
Breaute manerium de Seldelegia quod est de honore de Bedefordia, quia

Falkes in his <cite>Complaint to the Pope</cite> twice speaks of Bedford castle as his
own property: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">privilegio vestrae sedis per quae ... <em>tam castrum quam

Pope, writing to the King on 17th August, 1224, says “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">castrum de Betford
quod ipse pater tuus eidem [Falchesio] ... sicut dicitur, liberalitate regia,

<p>To understand these various statements we have first to determine what
was the relation between the honour of Bedford and the castle of
Bedford. The former had been given by William Rufus to Payne de
Beauchamp, and on land which formed part of it Payne built the castle.
Payne’s heirs were deprived of their patrimony by Stephen. After the
conclusion of the civil war they recovered their lands (<cite id="Note_10a">Dugdale, <i>Baronage</i>,
<abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 223</cite>), but not the castle, for in the <cite>Pipe Roll of 34 Hen. II
(1187–1188)</cite> the accounts of the sheriff of Bedfordshire include an item
of four pounds and six shillings spent “in the works of the castle of Bedford
and of the postern towards the water” (<cite>Goddard, <i>Siege of Bedford</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 17</cite>,
from <cite><i>Bedfordshire Archæological Transactions</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="12">xii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 249</cite>), a fact which
shews that the castle was then the property of the King. In 1189–1190
Simon de Beauchamp paid into the Treasury one hundred pounds, “to be
governor of the castle of Bedford” (<cite>Dugdale, <i><a href="#Note_10a" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">l.c.</a></i></cite>, from <cite>Pipe Roll 2 <abbr title="Richard the First">Ric. I</abbr></cite>).
These words clearly indicate that Simon was to hold the castle not in fee,
but as its constable for the Crown. The bargain between him and King
Richard may have included some understanding that the constableship
was to be hereditary (somewhat as another branch of the Beauchamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
family were hereditary constables of Worcester castle and sheriffs of
Worcestershire), for Simon was succeeded in it by his son William; it
was by entertaining the rebel barons in Bedford castle that William
incurred forfeiture in 1215 (<cite><abbr title="Roger of Wendover">R. Wend.</abbr>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="3">iii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 299</cite>). It is clear that
the seisin of Bedford castle was then, and had been for many years past,
in the Crown; John would therefore be perfectly within his rights if in
1216 he chose to alienate the castle altogether by granting it to Falkes in
fee. But the treaty of Kingston enacted that all men should be reinstated
in their rights (as well as their lands) as they had held them when the war
between John and the barons began. This definition would apparently
entitle William de Beauchamp to claim restitution of the constableship
of Bedford castle, if that office had been recognized by Richard and
John as hereditary. Beauchamp “came in” to King Henry in August,
1217, and orders were at once given for the restoration of some of his
lands (<cite id="Note_10b"><i>Close Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 319&nbsp;b</cite>); of the rest, including those in
Bedfordshire, he was granted restitution early in October (<cite><i><a href="#Note_10b" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 325&nbsp;b</cite>,
326). Falkes, however, was slow to loose his hold upon the honour of
Bedford, and further royal letters bidding him give Beauchamp full seisin
of it were issued in February, 1222 (<cite><i><a href="#Note_10b" title="Go to citation earlier in this note.">ib.</a></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 488&nbsp;b</cite>). Neither in these
letters nor in those of 1217 is there any mention of the castle.</p>

<p>Ralf of Coggeshall’s story is not self-consistent. He begins by stating,
as a positive fact, that John had given Bedford castle to Falkes by charter.
Afterwards, however, this fact dwindles down to an assertion reported to
have been made by Falkes in answer to a demand in 1223–1224 for restitution
of the castle either to the King or to Beauchamp. No charter
such as is here mentioned appears in the Charter Rolls of John’s reign.
This of course does not prove that no such charter ever existed; nor
does the fact that the Patent and Close Rolls of Henry’s reign contain no
hint of Falkes’s having ever, before the capture of Henry de Braybroke,
been summoned to deliver up the castle, prove that no such summons
was ever issued. The words of Falkes himself and those of the Pope&mdash;these
latter being of course based on information derived from Falkes
or his friends&mdash;imply that he claimed to hold the castle in fee. But even
if this claim was really based on a charter, it could scarcely have availed
to bar the claim of the King; for by the treaty of Kingston the Crown
as well as its subjects, was to regain whatever it had been seised of before
the war, and it had certainly been seised of Bedford castle from the
time of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr> till the autumn of 1215; it seems therefore that
Henry might have considered himself entitled to treat a charter granted
by his father after that date as null and void, and thus to call Bedford
<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">castrum nostrum</em>. With regard to its custody as a royal castle, the law
of the matter may very likely have been quite uncertain. It may have
been at least arguable that the definition laid down in the treaty did not
necessarily cover the custody of a royal castle even if held by hereditary
right; and it must be remembered that we do not know what was the
precise nature of the tenure by which Beauchamp had held that office.
The Barnwell writer, however, certainly appears to have gone too far in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
stating that the castle itself “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure spectabat ad Willelmum de Bello
Campo</span>.” It had belonged to William’s ancestors; but William’s father
had practically renounced all claim to its ownership by fining with King
Richard for the office of its constable. William’s right in it was at the
utmost only an hereditary title to that office. Whether John did grant the
castle to Falkes in fee, or whether he died seised of it himself (as Hubert
said)&mdash;having given merely the custody of it, as well as the enjoyment of
the honour of Bedford, to Falkes <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">quamdiu regi placuerit</em>&mdash;we cannot
determine. From Henry’s accession till autumn, 1223, any question
which might exist on the subject between Falkes and the Crown was of
little practical consequence. It was recognized on all hands that
throughout that period whatever castles Falkes held, whether as constable
or as lord, he held loyally for the King and used for the King’s interest
with a rare capability and diligence. Henry’s counsellors might well
prefer to leave this particular detail of the great castle-problem undiscussed
<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">usque ad aetatem regis</em>. Still more natural was it that Beauchamp’s
claim should get no hearing till Falkes had incurred forfeiture in his turn.
Then King and Council decided that it would be prudent to satisfy
Beauchamp without giving him a chance of treading in Falkes’s steps
or repeating his own act of 1215; and they did so by pulling the half
ruined castle down altogether and granting him the site, with leave to
build himself <i>not</i> a castle, but a dwelling-house, out of its stones (<cite><i>Close
Rolls</i>, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 632, 632&nbsp;b</cite>).</p>

<p>Now, Falkes certainly did not witness the scenes which he here describes.
They may have been reported to him by a member of the Council;
but we have no guarantee for the reporter’s truthfulness or accuracy, or
even for the report having originated elsewhere than in Falkes’s own brain&mdash;a
brain which, keen as it was in other respects, really seems to have been,
from some cause which we cannot fathom, hardly sane on matters in
which Stephen de Langton was concerned. The narrative clearly conveys,
and is clearly meant to convey, that it was Stephen who instigated the
hanging of the garrison; that he did so in veiled language which the young
King’s “innocence” at first failed to understand; that Stephen cast the responsibility
of explaining it on the Justiciar (whom, it will be remembered,
Falkes has all along represented as being hand and glove with the Archbishop);
that before even the justiciar could speak, its meaning was made
plain by one of three bishops whom the Primate had brought with him into
the King’s presence for that very purpose; that the laymen of the Council,
less bloodthirsty than the Primate, hesitated to adopt his suggestion and
put off the decision till after dinner; and that while all the barons were
occupied with that meal, the deed was done behind their backs (of course
under orders issued by the Justiciar in the King’s name), Stephen and his
three episcopal friends feasting their eyes on the sight. We should certainly
require some other authority than Falkes to make us accept this
story as he would have his readers accept it. But the main incidents of the
story may be true, and only their meaning perverted by the narrator; the
outlines of the picture may be correct, and only the colouring false. The
Bedford garrison had submitted to the King; they were therefore entitled to
be, after doing penance in the usual form, absolved from the excommunication
which had been pronounced against them for resisting him. But
they had submitted only on compulsion; therefore they were, by the law of
the land, still liable to the extreme penalty due to men who were taken
fighting against the person of their sovereign. The duty of the prelates
towards these prisoners was to enforce their penance and then give them
absolution; this the prelates had done; and therewith their part in the
Council’s action was at an end. The temporal fate of the prisoners was
a question of life or death, and in such questions, it is well known, ecclesiastics
had no voice. In a case such as the present one, it was for the
King’s lay counsellors to advise him, and for the King to decide; and if,
owing to a divergence of opinions among those counsellors or from any
other cause, the young sovereign thus called upon to exercise for the first
time such a weighty prerogative felt doubtful of its extent or of the right
direction in which to exercise it, the Justiciar was the person to whom he
should look for guidance. This, and nothing more, is the plain and natural
meaning of the words which Falkes places in the mouth of the Primate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
In themselves they afford no ground for the interpretation which he
evidently wished his readers to put upon them. Some of the barons were
still, it seems, leniently disposed towards Falkes; many of them may have
been reluctant to send brave soldiers to the gallows; if so, the execution
may have been carried out somewhat as Falkes states. His account of
the rescue of “some who are still”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, some nine months later&mdash;“detained
in custody” is easily reconciled with the story told by Matthew Paris
and the Dunstable annalist of the three who were given to the Templars.
The touch about the four prelates gloating over the ghastly scene may be
set down to a fevered imagination.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
